<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">All that summer you could spot him</p>
<p class="poemline">in cutoffs wandering the sands. Something</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">wasn’t right. When they slapped him on deck</p>
<p class="poemline">like some crucified tuna we said as much.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Below, he had curled in a manger of seaweed,</p>
<p class="poemline">having sprang from the prow to search</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the soft bay floor, bringing up junk (a steel</p>
<p class="poemline">box, some rope, a corroded picture frame)</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">he had chucked atoningly overboard some-</p>
<p class="poemline">time after the divorce. Treasure he called it.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">All afternoon he forsook us among the</p>
<p class="poemline">coughing engines, his rump turning and</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">turning the cold water, finding himself</p>
<p class="poemline">slowly less at home up top. Each vanishing</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">thinned our laughter, fomenting the repeat-</p>
<p class="poemline">miracle of his drenched head splitting the calm.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Cloud. Bird. Sail. We saw him for the last time</p>
<p class="poemline">near the slip. He sent up a few bubbles, then</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">swam to the dinghy, very quiet-like. We thought</p>
<p class="poemline">he was clowning. But the silence rippled</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">along the pier and the scant Christmas lights</p>
<p class="poemline">until they fished him out. His tummy full of vodka.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">His beard still clutching its share of ocean.</p>
</div>
