## The Good Gleam of the Satellite
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When it rose over the horizon as light</p>
<p class="poemline">turned blue to purple to black,</p>
<p class="poemline">it became my one true diamond.</p>
<p class="poemline">Here was something for my wanderings,</p>
<p class="poemline">something to cast upon my dreams</p>
<p class="poemline">and mythologies—Pegasus, my</p>
<p class="poemline">flashing white heart, a sun</p>
<p class="poemline">with no heat,</p>
<p class="poemline">a kite tethered to the curve of Earth.</p>
<p class="poemline">Nothing can leave me now.</p>
<p class="poemline">I will catch it in due course, lonesome</p>
<p class="poemline">traveler, wandering bard.</p>

## October Beatitude
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">What could I give,</p>
<p class="poemline">when the earth opens,</p>
<p class="poemline">and sunlight divides</p>
<p class="poemline">between stars, and night,</p>
<p class="poemline">all gold in the deep fire</p>
</div>
