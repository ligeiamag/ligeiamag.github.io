<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">This evening, the woods sprung into a hundred black bells.</p>
<p class="poemline">The trees were still smarting from the storm’s whooping,</p>
<p class="poemline">The hawks made their slow rounds waiting for a misstep.</p>
<p class="poemline">But dark skirts flapping, the forest pealed and pealed.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Have you ever seen such gaiety, in the eye of so much peril?</p>
</div>
