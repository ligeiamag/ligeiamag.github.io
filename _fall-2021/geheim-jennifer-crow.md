<p class="poemline">peace, they say, will be terrible</p>
<p class="poemline">full of banalities and consumer</p>
<p class="poemline">goods, too many varieties</p>
<p class="poemline">of potatoes and onions</p>
<p class="poemline">at the market and the neighbor</p>
<p class="poemline">playing his drums at midnight—</p>
<p class="poemline">this warning reminds us</p>
<p class="poemline">to enjoy the war, bootstrap</p>
<p class="poemline">our dreams and ration sugar</p>
<p class="poemline">and butter and eggs for the one</p>
<p class="poemline">birthday worth celebrating</p>
<p class="poemline">now—forget replacing your dress</p>
<p class="poemline">or shoes, though you’ll need</p>
<p class="poemline">a new lover after the shooting</p>
<p class="poemline">stops again—you’ll need a friend</p>
<p class="poemline">in the dark wood when the wolves</p>
<p class="poemline">come down from the mountains</p>
<p class="poemline">as they always do, seeking</p>
<p class="poemline">the soft and rotten flesh</p>
<p class="poemline">of a fallen world—<em>geheim</em></p>
<p class="poemline">the sign says, and we pay heed</p>
<p class="poemline">to signs because they’ll warn us</p>
<p class="poemline">about the end of the world, the end</p>
<p class="poemline">of the rope, the end beginning</p>
<p class="poemline">all around us, every day, forever</p>
