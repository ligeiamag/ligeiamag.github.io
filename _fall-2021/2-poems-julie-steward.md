## Up Next the Swimsuit Portion of the Pageant

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Lately Miss Texas, olive oil under an eyeball sun. Run,</p>
<p class="poemline">tan and glistening, from the backstage frantic</p>
<p class="poemline">to your hot spot in the spotlight and sister,</p>
<p class="poemline">start your walk.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Thank bikini bottom tape. Thank push up top, large breasts</p>
<p class="poemline">swelling like beautiful injuries. The mind is small</p>
<p class="poemline">talk and bluebonnets. Your concrete abs cut like</p>
<p class="poemline">Ginsu knives, and you could strut if you wished.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Later, the interview but now West Texas heat under</p>
<p class="poemline">familiar lights. Everyone’s envy as palpable</p>
<p class="poemline">as a pizza slice. Thank protein shakes and celery</p>
<p class="poemline">for your invisible thighs. Don’t ask why.</p>
<p class="poemline">You know all the answers by heart.</p>
</div>

## Saint Circus Circus Buffet

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">All hail most holy and nothing</p>
<p class="poemline">shrieks abundance like the buffet</p>
<p class="poemline">at the Circus Circus hotel Oh heed all hail</p>
<p class="poemline">have you ever seen its equal</p>
<p class="poemline">17 kinds of Jell-O and salads with nary</p>
<p class="poemline">a vegetable and our hands heavy</p>
<p class="poemline">with chips our winnings Oh order the wine</p>
<p class="poemline">players drink for free and freedom fine</p>
<p class="poemline">is a cornucopia bountiful pink and resplendent</p>
<p class="poemline">like the walls inside the belly of the whale</p>
<p class="poemline">like the walls inside the casino all hail</p>
<p class="poemline">the buffet at the circus and God</p>
<p class="poemline">there’s a circus at the Circus Circus</p>
<p class="poemline">oh trapeze oh horse rider oh lonely one</p>
<p class="poemline">with a buck fifty and change</p>
<p class="poemline">ask me to change oh charge me saint</p>
<p class="poemline">say the word and I’ll flagellate regurgitate</p>
<p class="poemline">ovulate I’ll ululate in the middle of the God</p>
<p class="poemline">damned Circus Circus buffet olé.</p>
</div>
