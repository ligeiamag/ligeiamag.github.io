<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Unladen mother wielding children hung in heaven for being aliens on a day of full</p>
<p class="poemline">and reasonable rest. They stick their thumbs into their noses as they bite their</p>
<p class="poemline">lizard tongues, scale in full glory of the sun and the moon and calypso the moon</p>
<p class="poemline">beast who eats fungus for breakfast that she grows on her own ankles. Who</p>
<p class="poemline">gives a fuck about the stomach pains it causes? Who cares about the scraping of</p>
<p class="poemline">nails on the inside of the belly and the mother who replays over and over in your</p>
<p class="poemline">mind yelling to the ceiling, to the ancient filth sitting in the crown molding, that her</p>
<p class="poemline">lover is dead dead dead, if she do or if she don’t? Who cares? You don’t. She</p>
<p class="poemline">told you so. She told you you didn’t give a fuck or you wouldn’t leave her there on</p>
<p class="poemline">her knees her hands buried in her hair. But you left her there on her knees,</p>
<p class="poemline">hands buried in her hair, pathetically sob sob sobbing. You left with the sherry,</p>
<p class="poemline">the whiskey, the sweet vermouth sloshing in your pocket and onto the train steps,</p>
<p class="poemline">onto the seat so it soaked the butt of your train neighbor. The neighbor gets</p>
<p class="poemline">large, and squares up, and their eyebrows are piercing, telling you to stop</p>
<p class="poemline">soaking them in alcohol and to have some self respect. Same old mantras, have</p>
<p class="poemline">some self respect, have some confidence, pull up your pants—your ass crack is</p>
<p class="poemline">showing, know who you are. Know what you want and grab it as if a cherry off a</p>
<p class="poemline">cherry tree. And your mouth opens suddenly, demandingly, in a loud and wailing</p>
<p class="poemline">‘O’. I do I do I do have self respect. I am am am am trying and I do do do care. I</p>
<p class="poemline">do do do care. I dodododo every day regularly. Every morning. That’s the effect</p>
<p class="poemline">of a plant based diet as the fungus eats you from the inside carving a new path</p>
<p class="poemline">for all back up to the hanging high heaven of yesterday. The place of full rest, the</p>
<p class="poemline">place where everyone blacks out and no one remembers, and no one blames</p>
<p class="poemline">you for not remembering.</p>
