## Ghost Pimple
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Mandy heads for malt and coffee. She passes through Can Robert and texts frantically:</p>
<p class="poemline">fruits, veggies, plants, summer dresses. Also bras. Six tables of bras. Think you would</p>
<p class="poemline">like the bras. On the other hand, she texts, it’s a jungle. Becoming puddle. Should have</p>
<p class="poemline">brought my camel hump. Charley looks out the window. We could build a submarine,</p>
<p class="poemline">she texts. Probably cooler under water, she texts. When Mandy arrives home, they</p>
<p class="poemline">malt and coffee. We need more elan vital, says Mandy. Yes, says Charlie. French</p>
<p class="poemline">fancies. They climb inside the symbolic submarine. Are you back in your childhood,</p>
<p class="poemline">says Mandy. Back, says Charlie. There too, says Mandy. I’ve always loved my smurfs,</p>
<p class="poemline">says Mandy. The little blue people. It was hard not to chew them. Little logs, says</p>
<p class="poemline">Charlie, I linked them together. We were more in touch with our bodies, says Mandy.</p>
<p class="poemline">Maybe we can get back there, says Charlie. When they climb out of the submarine, the</p>
<p class="poemline">room is full of teen spirits. Is this the peak of our existence, says Mandy, fingering her</p>
<p class="poemline">ghost braces. Hope not, says Charlie, squeezing out a ghost pimple.</p>

## Call of the Wild
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">That’s nice, I said, what kind of a name is Mildred. Gentle strength, she said. A bit</p>
<p class="poemline">marmalade on toast, I said. A bit cat and whiskers. Dusty wisdom of books, she said.</p>
<p class="poemline">Tea and crumpets, I said. Not really, she said. Beans and toast. She scooted closer.</p>
<p class="poemline">Snuggled down inside herself. Her pearly wisdoms. She scooted closer. Pitched a tent.</p>
<p class="poemline">The pang of the wild. They rang the buzzer. We chose each other. The hunt is over, I</p>
<p class="poemline">said.</p>
