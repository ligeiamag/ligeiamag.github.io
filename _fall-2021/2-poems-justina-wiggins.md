## Animal. Husbandry.

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">You shuddered when I held the fish cheeks in my hands and ate the sweet</p>
<p class="poemline">meat from a spider web of bones, sucked the fat through my teeth.</p>
<p class="poemline">I tried to convince you that it tasted like well water from a spigot,</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">delicate and metallic. That night I ran my fingers across your back until</p>
<p class="poemline">you snored. I went to sleep with the memory of bone on my tongue</p>
<p class="poemline">and dreamt of cracked lips and cresting waves. In the morning you rose</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">first, shoveled snow from the walk, scraped ice from the latch</p>
<p class="poemline">on the barn door, folded fresh hay into the chicken coop.</p>
<p class="poemline">When you meet me in the kitchen it is with a cock’s tail feather—</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">iridescent ink with chips of ice from resting in the snow.</p>
<p class="poemline">You’ve forgotten last night and the quick work my hands made</p>
<p class="poemline">of a skull. Now I’m aproned, creaming butter for cakes, pink</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">skinned from the stove’s heat. You tip the feather across my brow</p>
<p class="poemline">stand behind me, thumb the hem of my shirt as it hits my hips and bite</p>
<p class="poemline">at the curve of my neck. Yours is the mouth begging for eggs.</p>
</div>

## Advice on the Occasion of your Marriage


<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Learn to touch yourself first. Marry a man who will suck marrow through his teeth. Marry a man</p>
<p class="poemline">who buys thick cuts of meat and doesn’t complain when the butcher paper goes soft and his</p>
<p class="poemline">hands smell like blood. Never have a child with a man who is afraid of blood. Never marry a</p>
<p class="poemline">man who likes it. At some point in the marriage your husband will want to fuck another. Don’t</p>
<p class="poemline">worry. At some point you will too. Weigh hunger against patience. Marry a man who will suck a</p>
<p class="poemline">pit even after the sweet slick of fruit has gone. Learn to touch yourself first.</p>
</div>
