Look, I wish I could tell you that it gets better from here. I wish I
could tell you that once you crossed over into the territory things
would get easier ... but I'd be lying. It doesn't get better---not one
bit. Welcome to SHIPROCKLAND ... I hope you enjoy your stay.

There wasn't much left when we found her body. Left out here in this
godforsaken place, abandoned without a hint of remorse, so far from
everything she loved. How did they manage to drag her body so far out
here without anyone seeing a thing? She must've been so scared. She
didn't deserve this ... those fucking animals.

The sun was magnificent that day the shot rang out. Nobody thought he
had it in him. Nobody thought he was capable. He proved them all wrong.
You're all going to miss me when I'm gone! That's what he told them. And
now he was gone. All it took was one bullet. The sun was magnificent
that day.

There used to be a monument commemorating those who lost their lives to
this canal. My father used to call it "21 Lives" because that's how many
people's names were on the plaque at the time. That number is higher
now. And the monument no longer stands.

I don't quite remember how old I was the first time it happened. I think
I was like ten or twelve? He was drunk when he came into my room and lay
by me, I was small and he was my father, so I didn't think anything of
it, you know? He loved me and he was always passing out around the house
anyways, so I thought this was just one of those times. But then he
started nudging himself closer to me, spooning me. I didn't know what to
think. And then he put his arms around my waist and started caressing my
body, like he was searching for something. I tried to slide myself out
from under him but he pulled me back and dipped his hands between my
legs. I knew it was wrong, but I was too scared to move. Thinking back
on it now, I wish I said something to someone about it. But I didn't
want anyone to get in trouble---especially my father. I loved him and I
didn't want him to get hurt.

This used to be my cousin's house before we had to tear it down. My aunt
couldn't stand looking at it anymore. I guess it was too hard for her
seeing that house standing there all alone with no kids running around
outside making noise. She loved her grandkids a lot. She really did. And
I don't blame her. Every time I think about what happened to them I
can't help but feel bad. All because of another woman, can you believe
that? I mean, I can understand my cousin's reaction to finding out about
her husband cheating on her, but why did she have to hurt her kids like
that? They didn't deserve that. They really didn't. They're all buried
together, too, which makes it even worse.

After so much trauma and degradation and humiliation, this is what
remains ... beautiful isn't it?

Thank you for coming to SHIPROCKLAND ... I hope you enjoyed your stay.
