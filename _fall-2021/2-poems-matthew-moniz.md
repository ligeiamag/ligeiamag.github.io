## The Creation of Esperanto
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Hope–</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">or more accurately, <em>one who hopes</em>,</p>
<p class="poemline">a name chosen for a chosen language,</p>
<p class="poemline">wholecloth lingua franca, an attempt</p>
<p class="poemline">to unBabel, unpunish against anthem–</p>
<p class="poemline">anathema—the effort noble in a way</p>
<p class="poemline">that humans aren’t. It hopes</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">for less human humans, a gleaming</p>
<p class="poemline">city of the future, stainless steel without rivets,</p>
<p class="poemline">not our watersplotched metal.</p>
<p class="poemline">This cultural couture, this static</p>
<p class="poemline">fragment, guttural and gutterless,</p>
<p class="poemline">constructed consistent control for erudite elite,</p>
<p class="poemline">Eurocentric solution for Eurocentric problem.</p>
<p class="poemline">Anticipation of needs will not cover all needs.</p>
<p class="poemline">Definition of wants will not cover all wants.</p>
<p class="poemline">The creation of Esperanto ignored the slow</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">trickle, the muchness and muchness–</p>
<p class="poemline">from Protoindoeuropean etchings, irregular roots</p>
<p class="poemline">hold fast—held fast—through millennia</p>
<p class="poemline">of bloodstained heartbeats—drift, loan, shift, stone,</p>
<p class="poemline">trade and conquest, travel and love, sack, siege,</p>
<p class="poemline">sandpaper tongues—friction is a way of holding</p>
<p class="poemline">cistern words, stormeye syllabaries, baroque</p>
<p class="poemline">colloquialisms, with macrosyllabic ecosystems filling</p>
<p class="poemline">gaps in the blankness through raw structure of use,</p>
<p class="poemline">tongues flinging diction with casual purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Babies learn to smile by imitating smiles,</p>
<p class="poemline">and children must relearn irregularities—rough plough,</p>
<p class="poemline">tough dough. Language comes from the scratch</p>
<p class="poemline">of alcohol on the tongue, the <em>yawp</em> of a companioned</p>
<p class="poemline">wolf, gradual sophistication of the larynx, gradual</p>
<p class="poemline">cohesion of protophonemes, phenotypes scrabbling</p>
<p class="poemline">towards what we recognize now. Speakers and listeners</p>
<p class="poemline">must evolve simultaneously, vocal gestures accruing</p>
<p class="poemline">through mutinous isotopes, the convergent evolution</p>
<p class="poemline">of false cognates, erosion to vestige—feel stumps</p>
<p class="poemline">from wombtails—dialect as both wave and particle.</p>
<p class="poemline">A broken mirror makes many mirrors.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Fish don’t care about the rain, but the ghoti</p>
<p class="poemline">flops gasping out things and stuff as tapestry–</p>
<p class="poemline">a mosaic of threads. And when one frays, another slides</p>
<p class="poemline">in, mutable as myth, the action within abstraction,</p>
<p class="poemline">idiom ideation. Ow is the sound of ow,</p>
<p class="poemline">but french dogs say <em>ouaf</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We are not high elves in a void</p>
<p class="poemline">01100111 01101001 01110110 01101001 01101110 01100111 01100011</p>
<p class="poemline">01101111 01101101 01101101 01100001 01101110 01100100 01110011.</p>
<p class="poemline">As Esperanto accrues history,</p>
<p class="poemline">it will become more real–</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>ĉu ni atendu?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Carried on the breath, each language breathes–</p>
<p class="poemline">Latin for breath is <em>spiritus</em>, that which dwells</p>
<p class="poemline">within us. But I wrote this poem in English,</p>
<p class="poemline">the pirate tongue, that current overlord of mouths,</p>
<p class="poemline">so much of this is surely moot. In Esperanto,</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>moot</em> is not a meaningful root, so I lay this elegy</p>
<p class="poemline">down to rest.</p>

## Ode to the Tardigrade
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In an infinite universe,</p>
<p class="poemline">you survive smallness.</p>
</div>
