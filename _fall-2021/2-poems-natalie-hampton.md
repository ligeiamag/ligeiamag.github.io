## Postnatal Depression in the Time of Medusa

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A woman’s water bursts on the subway</p>
<p class="poemline">from Queens to Brooklyn. Penny-palmed</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">boy dips fingers in the puddle, says <em>mama /</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>look / she pissed herself.</em> She thinks to ask</p>
<p class="poemline">for help, but her tongue is a limp</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">muscle: whole, not yet clawed in half,</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one to form American syllables</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other to belong to her Homeland.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">She takes the next exit,</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dripping&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy water</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between both legs,</p>
<p class="poemline">body ripe with Life and Death,</p>
<p class="poemline">hands pressed to her pelvis and praying</p>
<p class="poemline">to gods for Help.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Child born on the streets: she</p>
<p class="poemline">doesn’t know the alley to the hospital.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Wandering between unfamiliar skyscrapers she</p>
<p class="poemline">meets a serpentine woman who buries stone</p>
<p class="poemline">shards and promises advice, says she too</p>
<p class="poemline">traveled the seas with nothing more than three</p>
<p class="poemline">drachma and a half-cracked spine she stitched</p>
<p class="poemline">together herself.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Her name and story, she says, were of mythology,</p>
<p class="poemline">and the woman-turned-mother asks no further questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">At the snake woman’s home,</p>
<p class="poemline">She&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;topples over statues like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dominos</p>
<p class="poemline">to make space</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for new embalmment victims,</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Curare stare victims.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">She likes them mortal and immortal,</p>
<p class="poemline">a conjunction:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the husk of a machine</p>
<p class="poemline">without oil running through vein pipes.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">To destroy your own creation:</p>
<p class="poemline">misguided mother Drowns baby</p>
<p class="poemline">in bathtub, law acute, all she knows</p>
<p class="poemline">how to cry are curses and piecemeal phrases:</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">She pleads innocence.</p>
<p class="poemline">They tear her body in two, cleave her tongue in half:</p>

## Orpheus in Bordertown and Eurydice in Abyss

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em><strong>Orpheus in Bordertown</strong></em></p>
<p class="poemline">1.	Orpheus was named for Greek mythology. Classic tale: hero rewarded in love, maiden suffers as he stumbles. No ailment for him but a grated-over heart, but heroes remarry and recover by dawn.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">2.	Orpheus liquified words for his parents’ mouths when he translated to their native tongue. They swallowed some and opened their mouths for the rest, unspoken words pooling out. A hereditary oil spill.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">3.	Orpheus played the piano while sober and the harp while drunk, music a language beyond lines drawn in sand. Sometimes he tried to pull notes from the air and fold them into origami cranes, but they melted in his grip. He could never sink his teeth wholly into permanence, pomegranate staining his mouth red before reaching the seeds.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">4.	Orpheus fumbled and sold his name like liquor, intoxicating the mind. Every time diluted, every mention mispronounced, it made its way down the foreign market. Syllables blended into one: he profited.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">5.	Orpheus drove border to border once a year. Bugs splattered his windshield; he mumbled prayers to each and imagined their final buzzing was singing and they died content with music born of their cuticle wings.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">6.	Orpheus met a girl named for Greek mythology. Untold tale: heroine coerced into love, ended life on her own terms. Wound on her ankle from viper strike but no hurt on her heart. To stay dead, she was content.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>They say he didn’t understand the instructions not to turn around.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em><strong>Eurydice in Abyss</strong></em></p>
<p class="poemline">1.	Eurydice was named for Greek mythology. Classic tale: hero rewarded in love, maiden suffers as he stumbles. No ailment for him but a grated-over heat, but heroes remarry and recover by dawn.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">2.	Eurydice walked along the edge of knives Tuesdays at dinner, feet slickened with oil and blood. The secret: don’t care if calluses are clawed off. Wounds feel freshest newly opened; don’t bother letting them heal.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">3.	Eurydice popped pills in the middle of the day, an internal social experiment. Some shredded her intestines until she could only eat unspoken words. Others frayed her mind until letters brought headaches in their wake. She preferred the ones that did both.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">4.	Eurydice forgot her name every weekend and borrowed a new one instead. She found it easier to live in another’s mind where the past was fictionalized and the future imaginary. When she returned to her own birth certificate, it never fit right.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">5.	Eurydice prayed to her own gods. Organized rituals never stuck, not like the privacy of her own room and mind. Invented specific gods for her particular needs, crafted out of desire and desperation. She awaited their answers.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">6.	Eurydice met a boy named for Greek mythology. Untold tale: heroine tested love but yearned for death instead. Wound on her ankle from viper strike but no hurt on her heart. To stay dead, she was content.</p>
</div>
