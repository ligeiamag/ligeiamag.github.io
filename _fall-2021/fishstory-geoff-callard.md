<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I came home to Dad grouting around the bathroom sink,</p>
<p class="poemline">muttering holy curses, the plastic shower curtain tied up,</p>
<p class="poemline">showing off its moldy hem, tiny window of frosted glass</p>
<p class="poemline">letting in a ghost of daylight, tools on the tiled floor,</p>
<p class="poemline">yellow bulb swinging above his head.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>Fucking Mother fucking Mary where the fuck this leak’s from, I’ll never fucking know</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A religious man, my father,</p>
<p class="poemline">a sensuously decaying man, lips like a fish,</p>
<p class="poemline">cold, fleshy entrance to a cavernous mouth,</p>
<p class="poemline">a blast of seafood breath.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">*</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">On the shores, some way from our apartment</p>
<p class="poemline">- when I say some way, I mean three changes on the bus and then the ferry -</p>
<p class="poemline">when I say the shores, I mean the real beach with waves</p>
<p class="poemline">and foam sucking into golden grained sand,</p>
<p class="poemline">gulls circling, rocks with sharp shells, fishermen out past</p>
<p class="poemline">the water pools, gaping holes that spume up and blow spray</p>
<p class="poemline">right back to the beach.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Around the cliffs is an alcove where the sea is still,</p>
<p class="poemline">not the deep blue that says <em>swim here</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>and I might have to kill you</em>;</p>
<p class="poemline">more turquoise, dappled,</p>
<p class="poemline">sunlight skylarking on endless wavelets.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Here I discovered creatures of stone, half human, half kelp,</p>
<p class="poemline">barnacles growing on their chests, between their legs,</p>
<p class="poemline">majestic beings, though broken in places.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">One still autumn evening, the king of them turned to me,</p>
<p class="poemline">just as I was leaving to catch the last ferry.</p>
<p class="poemline">You should know, he said, <em>I am your real father,</em></p>
<p class="poemline">and I rejoiced and danced up the beach and wept on the bus back home.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">*</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Later that weekend I held the wrench for my fish-breathed father</p>
<p class="poemline">as he pulled himself under the sink,</p>
<p class="poemline">swearing and stinking and sweating,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and I wondered about my lineage and who begat whom</p>
<p class="poemline">and stared with a mixture of horror and amazement</p>
<p class="poemline">at the tiny scales growing on my thighs.</p>
</div>
