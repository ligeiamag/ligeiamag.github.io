<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Come and visit me some time:</p>
<p class="poemline">hell, circle nine, round four,</p>
<p class="poemline">It’s cold here and nothing grows,</p>
<p class="poemline">not even the weeds of remorse.</p>
<p class="poemline">I used to have guests, you know,</p>
<p class="poemline">before I sent them down the river.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Nobody told me that</p>
<p class="poemline">when you kill the past,</p>
<p class="poemline">you become a shadow.</p>
<p class="poemline">Now that I have my freedom,</p>
<p class="poemline">someone who used to belong somewhere</p>
<p class="poemline">is using my toothbrush.</p>
<p class="poemline">There is no room left in my house</p>
<p class="poemline">for the gifts I didn’t give my sister.</p>
<p class="poemline">I used to have children, you know,</p>
<p class="poemline">before I harvested their innocence.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Do not begrudge me my twistedness,</p>
<p class="poemline">it is my homage to goodness.</p>
<p class="poemline">Even the devil cannot but praise God,</p>
<p class="poemline">although he praises by defiling.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I’ve buried myself</p>
<p class="poemline">where light cannot reach,</p>
<p class="poemline">cast the key into the void,</p>
<p class="poemline">but I’ll never be able</p>
<p class="poemline">to extinguish the sun.</p>
</div>
