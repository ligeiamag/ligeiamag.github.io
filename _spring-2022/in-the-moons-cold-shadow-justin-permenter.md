<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Do not stray, child, from the lamp lit path</p>
<p class="poemline">Though the wild ones whisper in the advent dark</p>
<p class="poemline">Pay no heed to the stirring and rustling of leaves</p>
<p class="poemline">The song of the deep forest or the call of the glade</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">For the wind carries with it a treacherous promise</p>
<p class="poemline">And deception lurks in the gathering gloom</p>
<p class="poemline">There, beneath rafters of branches and tendrils</p>
<p class="poemline">Lies the portal from beyond which no mortal returns</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">No moonbeams spill over the floor of the bower</p>
<p class="poemline">Where the limbs grow tangled in apses of green</p>
<p class="poemline">And hedges form palings of bramble and thornbush</p>
<p class="poemline">Around the great dais of the Eldergrove King</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">There sits the Sylvan Lord in his vesperal chamber</p>
<p class="poemline">Upon a fossilwood throne more ancient than time</p>
<p class="poemline">His vassals assemble in moss-bedecked companies</p>
<p class="poemline">And dance at his feet to the tune of the trees</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>Sha-ra-lee, sha-ra-lai,</em> calls the trembling timbrel</p>
<p class="poemline">While the revelers twirl to the beat of the drums</p>
<p class="poemline">But none gathered shall ever depart this dominion</p>
<p class="poemline">For their liege binds them all to his service and whim</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">So stay, child, stay where the lamplight shines</p>
<p class="poemline">Though the music beckons louder from the murmuring wood</p>
<p class="poemline">Tread not the dark path to the saturnine portal</p>
<p class="poemline">In the moon’s cold shadow, where the wild grass grows</p>
</div>
