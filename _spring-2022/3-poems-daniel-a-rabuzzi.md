## Breathing on a Wednesday
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In the long beginning, when the Earth still tasted sweet, when birdsong vermilion and bluer-than-blue</p>
<p class="poemline">was visible over flowers, when trees conversed with strangers, we wandered unafraid;-- until the first</p>
<p class="poemline">stirrings of those besotted with wounds, with shattered things and dust / whispering, whispering / odd</p>
<p class="poemline">songs of subdued but slowly blistering thoughts, glossy nettles leading to gripes, tormina, the false</p>
<p class="poemline">Queen’s Yellow to scourge our bones, a contorted forging to remove from us all but the scoria of our</p>
<p class="poemline">souls;--vaporous air, heavy with mercuried malice, exudation of a million saintless, pushing against our</p>
<p class="poemline">lungs, yet still we breathe, ragged pneumatics, pulsing, through a trochar through our flesh, yet on we</p>
<p class="poemline">breathe.</p>
</div>

## Searching For The Sphinx By The Fountain

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>“Dreaming my way back to my childhood,</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>Long-forgotten images rattle my gray and astonished mind. […]</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>There sits the Sphinx by the fountain,</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>There opens the fig-tree into bloom,</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>There, behind that window, I dreamed my very first dream.”</em></p>
<p class="poemline">&mdash;Adelbert von Chamisso, “The Boncourt Castle” (1827); translation by Daniel A. Rabuzzi.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Home is not a place,</p>
<p class="poemline">It’s a breaching, a breathing, a ghost</p>
<p class="poemline">Prismatic, asymptotic,</p>
<p class="poemline">Always</p>
<p class="poemline">Around a corner</p>
<p class="poemline">In a courtyard of lost grace and fading.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Home is a journey, <em>the</em> journey,</p>
<p class="poemline">No tickets, no schedules, stations obscured,</p>
<p class="poemline">Oneiric, charismatic,</p>
<p class="poemline">Always</p>
<p class="poemline">Behind failed glass and warping.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Home is the Sphinx with her questions,</p>
<p class="poemline">Fluid, ominous, lean (leaning),</p>
<p class="poemline">Speaking at once four languages</p>
<p class="poemline">On the borders of worlds past.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Respond,</p>
<p class="poemline">Placate, assure (indexical)</p>
<p class="poemline">Do not resist the joy</p>
<p class="poemline">Of communion,</p>
<p class="poemline">That is home.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>That</em> is home.</p>
</div>

## Praise-Songs
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The sorcerers sing words of charcoal,</p>
<p class="poemline">Weird-women weave spells of night,</p>
<p class="poemline">Requesting of the dark,</p>
<p class="poemline">For aid petitioning,</p>
<p class="poemline">To etch love and meaning with ebony</p>
<p class="poemline">Into the heedless white,</p>
<p class="poemline">Into the cold white shorelessness,</p>
<p class="poemline">Drawing from the warm wine-darkness</p>
<p class="poemline">For succor, for celebration,</p>
<p class="poemline">For songs to unstitch a shroud.</p>
</div>
