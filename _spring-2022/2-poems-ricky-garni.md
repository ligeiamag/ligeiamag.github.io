## Family Tradition
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I planted an apple tree in my backyard.</p>
<p class="poemline">200 years later, it uprooted my house.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Bad apple tree! my great great great</p>
<p class="poemline">grandchildren screamed, and they chopped</p>
<p class="poemline">and they chopped and they chopped</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the last of my life away.</p>
</div>

## Time Out
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">They say Dave Brubeck but come on</p>
<p class="poemline">what you really hear all the time is</p>
<p class="poemline">Paul Desmond, saxophone. I wonder</p>
<p class="poemline">if Dave Brubeck, piano, was annoyed</p>
<p class="poemline">by that Paul Desmond,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">saxophone. I wonder it if ever resulted</p>
<p class="poemline">in fisticuffs. I try to imagine Dave</p>
<p class="poemline">Brubeck’s fists, or Dave Brubeck’s hands</p>
<p class="poemline">picking up a piano in order that he might</p>
<p class="poemline">smite Paul Desmond. And then I try to imagine</p>
<p class="poemline">Paul Desmond picking up a saxophone in order</p>
<p class="poemline">to likewise or preemptively smite Dave Brubeck</p>
<p class="poemline">and as we speak, he is doing just that! Paul Desmond</p>
<p class="poemline">is picking up a saxophone but Paul Desmond is picking up</p>
<p class="poemline">a saxophone in order to play Blues Rondo À La Turk. Soon he</p>
<p class="poemline">shall be sweaty, soon Dave Brubeck will smile upon him</p>
<p class="poemline">lovingly, with thoughts of years and notes and ivory and</p>
<p class="poemline">gold, with a love forged of the metals and wood of such</p>
<p class="poemline">memories, and perhaps chastened, a bit, by sweat.</p>
</div>
