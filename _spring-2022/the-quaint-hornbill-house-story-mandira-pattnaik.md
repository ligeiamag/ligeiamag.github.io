<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A friend of mine once shot a dove.</p>
<p class="poemline">Its spouse, instead of fleeing,</p>
<p class="poemline">perched itself near the dead one.</p>
<p class="poemline">What a cry it was!</p>
<p class="poemline">I often compare it to paeans</p>
<p class="poemline">offered to remind the gods:</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>They needed to take care of us.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Adam picked it up, and like Dra Abu el-Naga,</p>
<p class="poemline">ventured to mount a series.</p>
<p class="poemline">The skeleton and musculature stayed under</p>
<p class="poemline">its plumage, freeze dried for posterity.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>Taxis</em>, he said, arrangement of the aligned souls</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>Dermis</em>, for skin, and memorializing feeling.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">If he looked at me when he uttered, he’d know:</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>There are other methods to record breach.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The dove in the middle of his home, like art, or sculpture,</p>
<p class="poemline">Like something threatened, retrieved.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Not so easy! The cries of its mate</p>
<p class="poemline">beneath its skin, layer upon layer upon layer,</p>
<p class="poemline">of curses and griefs,</p>
<p class="poemline">shrinking, warping, wrinkling Adam’s life,</p>
<p class="poemline">like it’d never been.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">If you ever been to the Hornbill House,</p>
<p class="poemline">may you climb the museum stairs, take the left,</p>
<p class="poemline">peruse the Siamese twin squirrels,</p>
<p class="poemline">mounted and dressed in Victorian gowns</p>
<p class="poemline">partaking in a game of croquet.</p>
<p class="poemline">I bet you’d see Adam next,</p>
<p class="poemline">hung upon cotton-wrapped wires</p>
<p class="poemline">with sewn-on cured skin.</p>
<p class="poemline">Just about staring at you</p>
<p class="poemline">in a life-like pose.</p>
</div>
