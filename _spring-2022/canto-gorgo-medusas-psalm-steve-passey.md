<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Let the bow lie unstrung on the arming table.</p>
<p class="poemline">Let man flee my presence for his shame.</p>
<p class="poemline">Let people have their small gods</p>
<p class="poemline">and small goddesses,</p>
<p class="poemline">their fires in their vessels of bronze.</p>
<p class="poemline">Let my sisters render my vengeance</p>
<p class="poemline">and let them have their grief.</p>
<p class="poemline">Let them crush the palaces of kings,</p>
<p class="poemline">and tread the houses of these thieves</p>
<p class="poemline">under the soles of their bare feet.</p>
<p class="poemline">Let all that remains of us</p>
<p class="poemline">be monument</p>
<p class="poemline">and song.</p>
