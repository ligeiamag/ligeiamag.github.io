<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Try balancing on one leg while peeing in the urinal</p>
<p class="poemline">of a restaurant restroom when no one is watching</p>
<p class="poemline">then return to a table to try out a new exercise:</p>
<p class="poemline">list the first five words that capture that scenario</p>
<p class="poemline">and ignore the waiter’s ass and the fit of his pants,</p>
<p class="poemline">his handheld pot of coffee, quite possibly a weapon.</p>
<p class="poemline">Choose to read closed captions on the closest TV set,</p>
<p class="poemline">one of a dozen flat screens suspended over diners,</p>
<p class="poemline">a funhouse hall of mirrors set free upon explosion,</p>
<p class="poemline">a pack of playing cards emptied for 52 pickup—</p>
<p class="poemline">where they landed, we now eat beneath them.</p>
<p class="poemline">A news broadcast announces a breaking story,</p>
<p class="poemline">a school shooting in a state that starts with an M,</p>
<p class="poemline">you sigh before chewing a piece of buttered bread.</p>
<p class="poemline">What words can be recycled, cut free from a menu?</p>
<p class="poemline">Stick a fork in your thigh and call it an issue.</p>
<p class="poemline">Smile at the smoker coughing outside the window.</p>
<p class="poemline">A stranger seated nearby tells herself she’s crying,</p>
<p class="poemline">like Siri joined mankind, then ate a handful of Valium.</p>
