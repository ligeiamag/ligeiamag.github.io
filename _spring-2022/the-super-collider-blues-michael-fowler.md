Sometimes when I get sad working on the super collider, looking for
traces of the neutrino and that mean old Higgs boson particle, I reach
for my Sears Roebuck guitar and play:

<div class="fowler" style="text-align:center;">
<p>Dark night, dark night</p>
<p>Fall in front of me, fall behind.</p>
<p>Black night, black night</p>
<p>Fall all around, yah.</p>
<p>Where is the Higgs boson hiding?</p>
<p>Where is the Higgs boson hiding?</p>
<p>Don’t you ask me I don’t know.</p>
<p>Don’t you ask me now I don’t know.</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;"></p>

My project leader comes over. If you don't find the alpha particle by
five, Ingmar, she says, I can't justify your annual salary of 180,000 E.
She looks at me hard. I know you're not dumb, she says, you're a Swede.

And I say, Who are you calling a Swede, tra-la? Do I say good morgun? Do
I eat herrings?

But the boss lady, she just sashays on down the hall, saying, Come off
it, Ingmar. You look and sound like those people in *Fargo*.

Seriously? I say. *Fargo*? I'm a bluesman.

I take up my Sears Roebuck guitar and play:

<div class="fowler" style="text-align:center;">
<p>I call that field Old Lighting</p>
<p>Where the neutrino goes to play.</p>
<p>I call that field anti-hydrogen</p>
<p>Before it flies away, yah.</p>
<p>Where has the anti-hydrogen gone?</p>
<p>Where has the anti-hydrogen gone?</p>
<p>Don’t you ask me I don’t know.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things now I don’t know.</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;"></p>

The boss lady comes back before noon. She points to the bubble chamber
and asks me what field are the anti-particles suspended in? I wipe my
brow and say to her, I call that field the yumpin yimminy power flow.

While she smacks herself in the forehead, I take up my guitar and play:

<div class="fowler" style="text-align:center;">
<p>O yumpin yiminy power flow</p>
<p>What your field strength is I got to show.</p>
<p>Don’t you leave me baby before I know</p>
<p>You old yumpin yiminy power flow.</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;"></p>

The boss lady tells me, Swede, we're not interested in musical physics
here. Come up with an explanation using strong and weak forces and leave
out the yumpin yiminys. She shows me her expensive new algae-powered
wristwatch and winks. What am I supposed to make of that? I know good
and well it's lunchtime because I keep my eye on the algae.

This deuce next to me, Pierre from Luxembourg or Belgium or someplace,
comes over and expresses a keen interest in my guitar. He takes me to
his cube and plays his flute after wiping that nasty cafeteria lunch off
his lips. That cafeteria lunch here at the super collider site is to be
avoided at all costs. It's all hard Brussel sprouts and high fat
dressing and strictly from smog-filled urban gardens.

With his lips now spotless Pierre pipes out an uplifting *Magic Flute*
Papageno birdsong with sunny skies crowded with chirps and tweets and
other Mozartian bird mayhem. Some days I see him fluttering and shaking
in his cube like a birdman himself. This is some weird cat, but he can
play. He quizzes me and asks where I came by my interest in American
blues music. It's odd to find someone with my straight blond hair and
blue eyes who isn't into ABBA, he says.

I tell him that before I came to the super collider I taught particle
physics at the University of Heidelberg for a few terms, busking around
campus under the name of Blind Louisiana Johansen, PhD. *And not a soul
bought my tapes!*

Before lunch is over Lisette from the Sorbonne comes over to say hello.
She's new and Pierre does the introductions, calling me an authentic
bluesman from the American south despite my ski slope-filled youth and
Nordic complexion. I'm the real deal, Pierre says, as she will see when
she hears me sing and play guitar. Either that or I'm a great kidder, he
says.

I take her fine hand and raise it to my lips. Enchante, I say.

Enchante, repeats Pierre, probably wishing he had my way with women.

Lisette says I do look like an Alpine skier rather than a blues hand,
and I get a little defensive. I go on MyBloodline.com, confident I am
the delta bluesman I identify as. Lo, the results come back 98% ice
fisherman and 1% highlander and 1% sawdust. *As good as Mick Jagger!* I
take up my guitar and play:

<div class="fowler" style="text-align:center;">
<p>Schussing in the Alps</p>
<p>I got the ski slope blues.</p>
<p>You left me here to freeze alone</p>
<p>And took away my snowshoes, yah.</p>
<p>Dark matter, dark matter</p>
<p>Where did my baby go?</p>
<p>Dark matter, dark matter</p>
<p>I yoost bet this Pierre guy knows.</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;"></p>

Late in the afternoon the boss lady tells me to do beta decay. Keep your
nose to the neutron, she says, or your head's on the block, Iceman.

I take up my guitar and play:

<div class="fowler" style="text-align:center;">
<p>I got the super collider blues</p>
<p>Down in my shoes</p>
<p>My baby has left me</p>
<p>Tell Heisenberg the news.</p>
<p>Now they call me Iceman and I’m confused, yah</p>
<p>I’ll do beta decay because I can’t refuse.</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-bottom:1rem;"></p>

At the end of the day I make an astonishing discovery: If I use open
tuning on my Sears Roebuck guitar instead of standard, I can play
"Smokestack Lightning!" Then the boss fires me for insubordination!
