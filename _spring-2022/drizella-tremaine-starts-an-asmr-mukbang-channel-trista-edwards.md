<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My kingdom for a moment of your scroll. Today, I slop down the hollow bone—</p>
<p class="poemline">Osso Buco, shank flour-dredged & tomato-sloshed with translucent onion curling</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">in gremolata profuse of garlic—& shuck free the tongue of fat by the grip of my spoon.</p>
<p class="poemline">My wet lips slurp seas of butter. Did you hear the juice? Was it amplified enough for you?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Please salivate in the comments. You can’t be ugly when you have all the cake,</p>
<p class="poemline">which I scarf for you now. I will be your pretty icing princess sticky with fame.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My sisters want castles & glass stilettoes & dainty pets. All I want is to feed you</p>
<p class="poemline">the thoughtful clack of my incisors against metal prong. Here, press your fingers</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">to the screen & I will suck your globules clean. If you come back next week,</p>
<p class="poemline">I will have spiced mutton threaded on skewers & brushed with a yogurt marinade.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">It will gargle like a boot stuck in mud. The chore is finding beauty in silence.</p>
<p class="poemline">Despite what Mother said, I never wanted a prince. My have my own palace</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">built on the <em>Likes</em> of my mouth which has always been beautiful, like this DM</p>
<p class="poemline">I got just now: <em>Drizella, you big, ugly mouse, you saint. please i love you don’t stop devour me.</em></p>
</div>
