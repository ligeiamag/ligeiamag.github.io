<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Have you seen the moon tonight?</p>
<p class="poemline">She is orange, fat, and riding low;</p>
<p class="poemline">she whispers, and I listen</p>
<p class="poemline">with careful tongue and seashell ears</p>
<p class="poemline">and she rolls across the sky</p>
<p class="poemline">lazy, decadent; gluttonous</p>
<p class="poemline">for us to hear her secrets</p>
<p class="poemline">and make our wishes upon her sister stars.</p>
<p class="poemline">What would we wish for?</p>
<p class="poemline">For something peeking out from behind</p>
<p class="poemline">the clouds, a flirtatious wind</p>
<p class="poemline">making love to our sails;</p>
<p class="poemline">a dream inspired by paths not taken;</p>
<p class="poemline">a forgotten attic, dusty boxes filled</p>
<p class="poemline">with a special kind of regret,</p>
<p class="poemline">the kind that smolders like a dying</p>
<p class="poemline">campfire, with bats dancing overhead.</p>
<p class="poemline">Can you hear the cricket song?</p>
<p class="poemline">We slake our thirst on their symphony</p>
<p class="poemline">and try to keep from going mad.</p>
<p class="poemline">I always try to find the three stars of Orion’s belt</p>
<p class="poemline">comforted that they have always been there</p>
<p class="poemline">a sturdy bridge, crumbling bricks</p>
<p class="poemline">with no troll beneath.</p>
<p class="poemline">The moon smiles</p>
<p class="poemline">as though she is keeping a delicious secret</p>
<p class="poemline">and we will see a little less of her tomorrow.</p>
