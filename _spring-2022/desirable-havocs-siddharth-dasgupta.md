<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Today, I will draw another equator</p>
<p class="poemline">through the tropics of my easterly</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">betrayals. This ambivalence of my skin</p>
<p class="poemline">—its desirable havoc, its sacred fire—</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">is where most of my stories are</p>
<p class="poemline">born, and breathe, their air mingling</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">with yesterday’s leftover weather,</p>
<p class="poemline">with the unruly human gardens where</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I’ve withered and prospered like</p>
<p class="poemline">some Old Romantic. With this new</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">equator, I shall move farther away</p>
<p class="poemline">from home, but because the earth</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">is unrestrained and befuddling, find</p>
<p class="poemline">myself even closer to home. A man</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of stories and absentminded weather.</p>
<p class="poemline">His body moving to the whims</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of two desirous equators, accented</p>
<p class="poemline">and etched like a faraway language.</p>
</div>
