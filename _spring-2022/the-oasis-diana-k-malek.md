<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The locals called the pond The Oasis although</p>
<p class="poemline">It didn’t live up to the name.</p>
<p class="poemline">Water green as an old penny and thick</p>
<p class="poemline">With algae, hugged by a grove of thin birch trees, a small pond</p>
<p class="poemline">That fed into a stream and disappeared</p>
<p class="poemline">Through a concrete cylinder under the wide paved road</p>
<p class="poemline">That led out of town.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Men used to come, with six-packs of beer and rubber boots</p>
<p class="poemline">To fish for the trout old man Pilch had put in even though</p>
<p class="poemline">It hadn’t been his pond to stock. But</p>
<p class="poemline">That didn’t stop him from pulling up one day in his truck and dumping</p>
<p class="poemline">A box of colored trout, one by one with his bare hands</p>
<p class="poemline">Into the water.</p>
<p class="poemline">The field next to the pond had been Pilch’s, and</p>
<p class="poemline">He had grown potatoes on it with his son</p>
<p class="poemline">But now the bank owned it, the bank had eaten</p>
<p class="poemline">Old man Pilch, and his son, and the field and</p>
<p class="poemline">Spit out their bones</p>
<p class="poemline">Like an owl who had caught three mice, fitting them, all three</p>
<p class="poemline">Into its widely opening cheeks.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">To get to The Oasis you had to cross the field, fermenting now</p>
<p class="poemline">With wildflowers and ragweed, navigating the bony scattering of bushes</p>
<p class="poemline">Bearing their tiny painful brambles, your eyes</p>
<p class="poemline">Cast down for snakes</p>
<p class="poemline">A sign, For Sale—Will Build To Suit, sunk into the dirt by the side of the road</p>
<p class="poemline">Had been there for years and someone had spray painted</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>James K eats farts</em> across it in a truculent reddish purple.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Teenagers destined for greatness or sadness or an early death</p>
<p class="poemline">Who crept out to the pond at night with flashlights</p>
<p class="poemline">Left empty bottles of Fireball whiskey and flavored</p>
<p class="poemline">Cigar wrappers, glossy McDonald’s fry containers and sometimes</p>
<p class="poemline">A used condom.</p>
<p class="poemline">Flies and bees buzzed about the colorful garbage, glinting</p>
<p class="poemline">Like warmed treasure in the sun.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Old man Pilch had passed</p>
<p class="poemline">Going on three years now and during the day</p>
<p class="poemline">It was quiet—the pond grown</p>
<p class="poemline">Too thick with green stench and the cat tails too tall</p>
<p class="poemline">For the men to fish anymore.</p>
<p class="poemline">The pond was sinking into its own oblivion or maybe</p>
<p class="poemline">The pond was changing its very nature, following after Pilch himself.</p>
<p class="poemline">Either way</p>
<p class="poemline">I was surprised to meet her, the girl on the pond’s shore.</p>
<p class="poemline">I guess I’d taken to considering the place mine during the day.</p>
<p class="poemline">Yes it certainly felt like it was mine—and it felt right to feel that way—as if</p>
<p class="poemline">After old man Pilch died</p>
<p class="poemline">The pond longed to be coveted again</p>
<p class="poemline">By someone to whom it didn’t belong.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Of course, the pond shore wasn’t a shore at all</p>
<p class="poemline">In truth it was nothing but a giant sandy anthill, still</p>
<p class="poemline">There she was perched atop it</p>
<p class="poemline">A small pale girl with a front tooth missing</p>
<p class="poemline">Hair the color of butter and cheeks crisping in the sun, her eyes</p>
<p class="poemline">Skimmed milk sitting in two large, blue saucers.</p>
<p class="poemline">She had surrounded herself with a circle</p>
<p class="poemline">Of naked Barbie dolls.</p>
<p class="poemline">She looked up at me stoically and said</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>For his crimes he has to walk the plank</em></p>
<p class="poemline">And indeed she had a small piece of lumber angled</p>
<p class="poemline">From the hump of the anthill down into the pond, and solemnly</p>
<p class="poemline">She walked a single male doll down that rectangle</p>
<p class="poemline">And walked him into the water, her narrow hand and forearm disappearing</p>
<p class="poemline">Briefly into that thick green sludge leaving, as she pulled it out,</p>
<p class="poemline">The doll to suffer its fate.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">It began this way, just me</p>
<p class="poemline">Observing her small, strange ritual and her, watching mine</p>
<p class="poemline">Which was to crack open just one nip of vanilla vodka</p>
<p class="poemline">And light just one, and then just one more, wide Camel cigarette</p>
<p class="poemline">And then rinse with a swig of the preposterously blue mouthwash I spat</p>
<p class="poemline">After, with an attempt at grace—</p>
<p class="poemline">If spitting can ever be a graceful act—into the sand at my feet.</p>
<p class="poemline">And in the way I didn’t ask her about how she found her religion</p>
<p class="poemline">She didn’t ask me about the origin of mine and we shared the dying</p>
<p class="poemline">Pond that day, the pond sinking</p>
<p class="poemline">Into its own oblivion and when I returned the following day she was there</p>
<p class="poemline">As well, and waiting, it seemed, and the pond it seemed</p>
<p class="poemline">Was waiting also and soon</p>
<p class="poemline">I sat with her inside the mandala of naked Barbies</p>
<p class="poemline">Brushing the biting ants off my legs, watching</p>
<p class="poemline">Several more plastic men go into that accursed drink</p>
<p class="poemline">Sun shining off her hair, that pale yellow hair</p>
<p class="poemline">The color of the yolk of a sick egg, milk blue eyes blinking</p>
<p class="poemline">In concentration, as I inhaled my cigarette</p>
<p class="poemline">And exhaled the smoke on the doll’s faces which the girl said</p>
<p class="poemline">Would help to cleanse them.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Eventually she ran out of the men dolls and so we entertained ourselves</p>
<p class="poemline">By dragging an ancient, peeling red rowboat, beached up in the birch grove,</p>
<p class="poemline">Down to the pond and pushing it in.</p>
<p class="poemline">There was only one oar and the boat took on water</p>
<p class="poemline">Very slowly the dark green water.</p>
<p class="poemline">We kicked our feet in it and I told her how, a long time ago</p>
<p class="poemline">When I was her age</p>
<p class="poemline">I had a salamander that had grown too large for his tank, too</p>
<p class="poemline">Ravenous for the small brine shrimp and nightcrawlers I slipped</p>
<p class="poemline">Under the glass into that moist void at night and so I released him</p>
<p class="poemline">Into this very pond.</p>
<p class="poemline">The girl thought about this, her blue-white eyes staring intently</p>
<p class="poemline">At the putrid water while I slogged</p>
<p class="poemline">The oar through the algae, thick as dry yarn balls and</p>
<p class="poemline">Whenever the water rippled here or there underneath the green filth she exclaimed</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>Maybe that’s him</em></p>
<p class="poemline">And we both imagined him, the salamander, each time she said it.</p>
<p class="poemline">Each time she said it we saw him, grown huge and scaled and dark</p>
<p class="poemline">Circling the bottom of the rank green pond</p>
<p class="poemline">Feeding on the corpses of the dead trout, lived</p>
<p class="poemline">Beyond his natural life, forgotten</p>
<p class="poemline">By both life and death</p>
<p class="poemline">A wingless dragon, dark lord</p>
<p class="poemline">King of The Oasis</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">—and weren’t we his Queens?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Weren’t we, mirroring his slow dark circles below with ours</p>
<p class="poemline">In the boat above, sun burning our cheeks</p>
<p class="poemline">Toes wrinkling in the thick water that slowly</p>
<p class="poemline">Filled the bottom of the old, peeling red boat, and</p>
<p class="poemline">The girl looked at me and how could she have thought</p>
<p class="poemline">The exact same thing, how</p>
<p class="poemline">And at exactly the same time, but</p>
<p class="poemline">She did</p>
<p class="poemline">And she answered <em>well, we are his Queens</em> and she answered</p>
<p class="poemline">Without speaking a word and her eyes were nothing more</p>
<p class="poemline">Than the Earth itself, seen from outside itself, and doubled,</p>
<p class="poemline">Blue and white spheres filled</p>
<p class="poemline">Just so utterly filled with life.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And so we sat, and circled the wretched pond</p>
<p class="poemline">As though tracing the shape of the crowns</p>
<p class="poemline">On our heads, listening</p>
<p class="poemline">To the occasional car gun</p>
<p class="poemline">Down the wide paved road that led out of town, the branches</p>
<p class="poemline">Of the birch trees softly shuddering</p>
<p class="poemline">The ring of naked dolls on the shore watching over us and</p>
<p class="poemline">If you asked me how it was her ritual had worked, the physics of it</p>
<p class="poemline">Or the math I couldn’t</p>
<p class="poemline">Even hazard a guess but</p>
<p class="poemline">The dolls’ faces had become, somehow</p>
<p class="poemline">Our very own faces</p>
<p class="poemline">Bitten into and into</p>
<p class="poemline">By the tireless ants, motionless</p>
<p class="poemline">Cleansed</p>
<p class="poemline">Sitting without blinking in a circle that moved nowhere</p>
<p class="poemline">Both nowhere and everywhere at once.</p>
