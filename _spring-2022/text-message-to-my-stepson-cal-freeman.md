<p class="poemline">You remember that tree of heaven,</p>
<p class="poemline">also called stinking sumac, also called varnish</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">tree, also called ailanthus altissima</p>
<p class="poemline">of the Simaroubaceae family that bowed</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the fence on Drew’s side</p>
<p class="poemline">when you were a kid?</p>

<p class="poemline">It seems serendipitous and strange</p>
<p class="poemline">that you spent countless hours</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">kicking a soccer ball beneath it</p>
<p class="poemline">and are now studying the benefits</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of the quassinoids such putrefying</p>

<p class="poemline">What heals heals. The chain link</p>
<p class="poemline">bellied out, the boy</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">you were gone to another state.</p>
