*Ghostly departure and watchful highness,\\
even if you leave behind a list of what has been accomplished\\
by your love, as long as we are left to rot,\\
remarkable light of our life, then what's the use?*

In Marlon Hacla's *Melismas*, destruction and restoration live in the
same breath. This stunning book-length poem, translated from the
original Filipino by Kristine Ong Muslim, explores loyalty, despair,
suppression, love of country, love for the other, and the way the
struggles of daily life are compounded by large-scale structural
failings. In reading *Melismas*, the reader is invited to become part of
an almost scriptural meditation on countless unnamed cruelties executed
in an unnamed country. Interspersed throughout these tidings of viscera
and doom are recognizable glimmers of light which momentarily soothe the
tonal fire---an unsolicited rooftop reading, "a day of feverish /
beauty"---reinforcing the illusion of contentment within a way of life
which is ultimately unsustainable. As a result of this uneasy dichotomy,
*Melismas* is anticipatory, always standing on the precipice of action.
In this way, the poem positions itself in that uncertain space just
before upheaval in a manner that is guaranteed to resonate with today's
readers. As Amado Anthony G. Mendoza III notes in his introduction to
the book: "words can only ever articulate one's desire or plan to
speak."

Illustrating this "divide that stifles the articulation," the syntax
teems with deliberate distortions of language and of imagery. Like "the
rain's red body" which "sneaks into rivers," objects and images
undulate, negotiate meaning, and are swept away in the feverish pace of
Hacla's invocation. This fluidity paves the way for innovative uses of
language which, in turn, beget a translation that is lucid and
relentlessly visceral. Relatedly, the voice of the poem is contemplative
and distraught, always caught between the light and the dark. It
struggles with the burning desire to manifest something lasting in the
face of the insurmountable knowledge of human obsolescence. This
uncertainty contributes to the distinctive polytonality which lends the
poem its name: *melismas*, the act of singing a single syllable while
moving between several notes, implying that *Melismas* is not only a
poem, but a song; it is a collection of disparate, often opposing tones
strung together to create a work that is rhythmically inventive and
textured.

The polytonality which churns *Melismas* forward is further heightened
by two factors: the fact that it is a work in translation, and the fact
that it is a work that is illustrated. These two conceits extend the
book's already intriguing texture beyond the linguistic and into the
visual. Kristine Ong Muslim's translation mirrors the original Filipino
on subsequent pages, creating a sort of conversation. This bilingual
back-and-forth is further informed by Muslim's insightful write-up "A
Note on Translation," which can be found in the beginning of the book,
after Mendoza's introduction. In her essay, Muslim explains that the
translation of *Melismas* was largely "done by feel, by intuition," in
order to capture its frantic urgency and to recreate its shadowy nuances
in their purest forms. Tilde Acuña's haunting illustrations do much the
same thing. Most of the art in the book either depicts human forms made
up of continuous white lines on black backgrounds or skeletal figures
scratched out in black against the white page. They are haunting and
charged with an oppressive energy which brilliantly embodies the
simultaneously corporeal and phantasmic nature of the poem.

All in all, *Melismas* is a collection of---and about---small victories.
There is a stubborn, wholly human glimmer optimism lying dormant beneath
the nightmarish rubble of a world gone to ruin. That is to say, despite
having a narrative arc which illustrates that "there is never going to
be an end / to our unease," this is a book which ends, in the face of it
all, not with sirens or laments or great bells tolling, but with a
lover's final "parting song."
