<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>For cricket</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">1.</p>
<p class="poemline">Autumn body is stiff like the trunks and branches.</p>
<p class="poemline">The leaves already learning how to shiver.</p>
<p class="poemline">By Tuesday, every tree top has decided it wants to be a redhead</p>
<p class="poemline">and some have started to go blonde on the bottom—frosted tips soon.</p>
<p class="poemline">Me, i have already done the bleach,</p>
<p class="poemline">already let you run your fingers over my skull. My scar</p>
<p class="poemline">from that winter of sledding and ice.</p>
<p class="poemline">My crooked harvest moon, a cutting silver that feels bright against your scissors.</p>
<p class="poemline">They sometimes call you a twig</p>
<p class="poemline">as if you could ever crack,</p>
<p class="poemline">but i do believe inside</p>
<p class="poemline">you are always fresh, and green. i think i am thick and rough like a tree,</p>
<p class="poemline">but i can’t just let these gnarled roots be. You know what i mean?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">2.</p>
<p class="poemline">i placed the tops of acorns on your eager finger tips.</p>
<p class="poemline">The wind was blowing, and you needed a hat more than your fingers</p>
<p class="poemline">did. You were rushing in the trees on the east side of Harriet</p>
<p class="poemline">when we should have been west. You were blowing</p>
<p class="poemline">through me, waiting for my creak and lean.</p>
<p class="poemline">My neck, a sloping bough for your sparrowed flock of fingers.</p>
<p class="poemline">Your arms, a wingspan i can fold my limbs into.</p>
<p class="poemline">i know it’s me who is too eager to tip.</p>
<p class="poemline">Splinter me down the middle, my timber, your kindling.</p>
<p class="poemline">Later in the orchard you will tell me not to throw rotting fruit.</p>
<p class="poemline">i throw the cider sick flesh anyway as if to say,</p>
<p class="poemline">i want it all soft like a peach, but I know you are apple season.</p>
<p class="poemline">i dig my thumb in it’s all skin, crunch, and meal,</p>
<p class="poemline">The sky—crisp enough to bite into.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">3.</p>
<p class="poemline">i couldn’t tell if it was the grass or the laying</p>
<p class="poemline">or the way you pulled at my sleeve, hooked onto me</p>
<p class="poemline">like a daisy chain. Your dandelion mane rolling (what a day!)</p>
<p class="poemline">But i swear when your head dipped honey dripped out.</p>
<p class="poemline">i saw hexagonal catacombs sticking in the crevices of your ears and mouth.</p>
<p class="poemline">You eat a chicken sandwich and i think “out of the eater i found something i could eat.”</p>
<p class="poemline">Lil texted me that story of Samson, the hive, the lion skull, and</p>
<p class="poemline">somewhere it is said if you</p>
<p class="poemline">split a honey bee you can lick its sweetness clean out.</p>
<p class="poemline">You’re still linked to my sleeve while i turn to see gold in between the leaves</p>
<p class="poemline">of the tree i’ve been watching from my porch since i moved in September.</p>
<p class="poemline">i am not the starling family held between its branches, but i’m held.</p>
<p class="poemline">i want their memory that photographs</p>
<p class="poemline">and holds this like they hold a shining thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">4.</p>
<p class="poemline">Leaning is our language.</p>
<p class="poemline">Like those two pines on the bank of St. Croix</p>
<p class="poemline">where i camped in September.</p>
<p class="poemline">When the wind blew, they</p>
<p class="poemline">would bend into each other and grind.</p>
<p class="poemline">i knew how warm the space must be where their bark met.</p>
<p class="poemline">How tangled their branches could get.</p>
<p class="poemline">How time has its own curve and buckle.</p>
<p class="poemline">Like the river below the safety of their netted canopy.</p>
<p class="poemline">i remember the one tree reaching, and reaching.</p>
<p class="poemline">Learning to lean without toppling.</p>
<p class="poemline">What i mean to say is you aren’t in this poem.</p>
<p class="poemline">There is just me and all my leaves</p>
<p class="poemline">Shivering.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">5.</p>
<p class="poemline">Ghosts are better than nothing. We still want something:</p>
<p class="poemline">spread out white and crisp across the page.</p>
<p class="poemline">i know your ancestors’ hands before you email me the picture of your aunt.</p>
<p class="poemline">i’ve held them like a seed in a pod. I’ve seen them rattle and shake.</p>
<p class="poemline">i’ve hardened around you. A shell of something that still wants.</p>
<p class="poemline">i dropped us like an empty walnut on concrete</p>
<p class="poemline">craving the sound of hollow,</p>
<p class="poemline">but when i kissed your forehead,</p>
<p class="poemline">I smelled sweetgrass, smoke and</p>
<p class="poemline">the rotting pith we forgot to plant this summer.</p>
<p class="poemline">How many of your ancestors want me to remember their hands? And how many of mine want</p>
<p class="poemline">you to pick squash as the moon wanes?</p>
<p class="poemline">When i get home, the soup you made is still warm.</p>
<p class="poemline">They tell me to pick out the bones.</p>
