## Fresh-aired and sky-blue
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">cars ticking forward</p>
<p class="poemline">in a row of commuters</p>
<p class="poemline">like links on the chain</p>
<p class="poemline">of a bicycle. the day</p>
<p class="poemline">is quite clear, fresh-aired</p>
<p class="poemline">and sky-blue. I am walking</p>
<p class="poemline">on the quayside</p>
<p class="poemline">past croppy acre park,</p>
<p class="poemline">drinking a cup of coffee,</p>
<p class="poemline">thinking about what</p>
<p class="poemline">to have for lunch.</p>
<p class="poemline">my girlfriend’s out too,</p>
<p class="poemline">though she’s elsewhere;</p>
<p class="poemline">she is walking the river</p>
<p class="poemline">with ani, her friend.</p>
<p class="poemline">when I see her</p>
<p class="poemline">she’ll tell me</p>
<p class="poemline">how they came on</p>
<p class="poemline">a swan, or the end of one</p>
<p class="poemline">anyway; a fox-eaten body</p>
<p class="poemline">lying by the liffey-</p>
<p class="poemline">side footpath. white wings</p>
<p class="poemline">flat out, a pieta of tragedy,</p>
<p class="poemline">and a ribcage collapsed</p>
<p class="poemline">in the manner of girders</p>
<p class="poemline">in buildings. flowers bob</p>
<p class="poemline">in the breeze</p>
<p class="poemline">and in time</p>
<p class="poemline">as cars pass.</p>
<p class="poemline">leaves blow along</p>
<p class="poemline">on the pavement like stones</p>
<p class="poemline">being skipped over</p>
<p class="poemline">stretches of water,</p>
<p class="poemline">though the crumpled ones scuttle</p>
<p class="poemline">and tumble more slowly;</p>
<p class="poemline">they move more like crabs</p>
<p class="poemline">on a beach.</p>

## Chrysty is acting
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">like she’s really</p>
<p class="poemline">quite mad at me.</p>
<p class="poemline">I forgot myself</p>
<p class="poemline">last night</p>
<p class="poemline">and finished her wine.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and before that</p>
<p class="poemline">she tripped</p>
<p class="poemline">on my shoes</p>
<p class="poemline">in the hallway.</p>
<p class="poemline">and before that</p>
<p class="poemline">I dribbled some piss</p>
<p class="poemline">on our tile. and then</p>
<p class="poemline">was my short thing</p>
<p class="poemline">(of course)</p>
<p class="poemline">with amanda.</p>
<p class="poemline">and before that</p>
<p class="poemline">the business</p>
<p class="poemline">with her</p>
<p class="poemline">and with paul.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">we share this apartment</p>
<p class="poemline">like dogs in a dogpound.</p>
<p class="poemline">snarl over coffee</p>
<p class="poemline">and toast.</p>
</div>
