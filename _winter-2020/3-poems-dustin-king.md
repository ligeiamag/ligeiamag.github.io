## chirp
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">trunks to the navel</p>
<p class="poemline">not a tooth bruised or brushed</p>
<p class="poemline">jackknife into tidepool</p>
<p class="poemline">sharpest barnacle in the ocean</p>
<p class="poemline">tidal wave took a lover</p>
<p class="poemline">eyes dangle bloodshot</p>
<p class="poemline">time for a swimming spree</p>
<p class="poemline">break surface to flee dolphin</p>
<p class="poemline">hit shore to outrun tornado</p>
<p class="poemline">still my spear points backwards</p>
<p class="poemline">wetsuit moldy</p>
<p class="poemline">boat only decelerates</p>
<p class="poemline">teeth chatter shatter</p>
<p class="poemline">gums peel bleed</p>
<p class="poemline">gulls chirp malice</p>
<p class="poemline">we join in</p>
<p class="poemline">i beg little perch</p>
<p class="poemline">bite me until</p>
<p class="poemline">i want to be touched</p>
<p class="poemline">touch me until</p>
<p class="poemline">i want to be bit</p>
<p class="poemline">tuck me in</p>
<p class="poemline">until I wake to mourn</p>
<p class="poemline">this nightmare</p>

## The Buzzard
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The buzzard was picking raccoon in the median</p>
<p class="poemline">when it became the roadkill.</p>
<p class="poemline">Grampa in his starched shirt tossed it in the trunk of the sedan.</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>We are going to scare your mother.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I was thinking even buzzard babies are cute</p>
<p class="poemline">nestling in broken eggshell, hay and twigs,</p>
<p class="poemline">purple yarn, maybe bear hair.</p>
<p class="poemline">Then of a buzzard streaking it’s feathers</p>
<p class="poemline">with human child,</p>
<p class="poemline">maybe I was lost in the woods,</p>
<p class="poemline">regurgitated half-digested into their</p>
<p class="poemline">offspring’s snapping beaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Pa crucified the buzzard,</p>
<p class="poemline">wings nailed to the barn, an eye missing,</p>
<p class="poemline">bald head sagging as if in prayer for the end of us.</p>
<p class="poemline">How many piles of our bones</p>
<p class="poemline">has a satisfied buzzard flapped away from?</p>
<p class="poemline">Indeed Mom screamed like she’d seen Death.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Do buzzards become cannibals when a buzzard becomes carrion?</p>
<p class="poemline">Wouldn’t sweet decomposition be a gift?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The buzzard answered,</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>Burial is not buzzard tradition,</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>each body is an offering,</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>the descending swirl of kin is</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>heaven approaching,</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>our kind is only beautiful at a distance,</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>let me see us soaring one last time.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Pa was inside the house with a crossword,</p>
<p class="poemline">Mom fixing dinner.</p>
<p class="poemline">My father dropped the carcass in a garbage bag</p>
<p class="poemline">and I think it went to the dump.</p>
</div>

## Lake Moomaw
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Some small soldier academics thought</p>
<p class="poemline">they could alter earth and made me</p>
<p class="poemline">but now I reroute the wind</p>
<p class="poemline">redirect sunbeam</p>
<p class="poemline">collect every drop of rain</p>
<p class="poemline">and mountain stream</p>
<p class="poemline">like meteor dust</p>
<p class="poemline">the trees standing at attention</p>
<p class="poemline">their beasts drawn</p>
<p class="poemline">by the inner magnetism of thirst</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I am no lady</p>
<p class="poemline">I lap up your spilt beer and urine</p>
<p class="poemline">swallow your skipping rocks and oars</p>
<p class="poemline">hear you quietly hump in your tents</p>
<p class="poemline">caress you myself as you swim me</p>
<p class="poemline">naked by starlight</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And that’s no beach bod</p>
<p class="poemline">it was made for a lake</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Here is my gift in return</p>
<p class="poemline">a few more feet of shore</p>
<p class="poemline">I match the aqua green</p>
<p class="poemline">sky blue of your irises</p>
<p class="poemline">cure your hangovers</p>
<p class="poemline">all you need is a rope swing</p>
<p class="poemline">or a floaty- wedding ring,</p>
<p class="poemline">flamingo, pizza slice</p>
<p class="poemline">lose your mind a little</p>
<p class="poemline">quiet the tyrant in your head</p>
<p class="poemline">emerge with precision of purpose</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And if it is with mud behind your ears</p>
<p class="poemline">It’s because I was whispering</p>
<p class="poemline">the secrets of the drowned and living</p>
<p class="poemline">the forest would rather mute</p>
<p class="poemline">carried by my stillness</p>
<p class="poemline">campfire to campfire</p>
<p class="poemline">each imagining the other more lost</p>
<p class="poemline">but they are the same troubles</p>
<p class="poemline">a bit of untruth making every story realer</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Or I sing to you</p>
<p class="poemline">the syllables of thunder</p>
<p class="poemline">waves smack shale</p>
<p class="poemline">kindling split</p>
<p class="poemline">a cicada scream</p>
<p class="poemline">woodpecker thump</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">All this you will dream when you’re gone</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The dam cracks and I am free</p>
<p class="poemline">there is no warning mist as</p>
<p class="poemline">I wash clean every town</p>
<p class="poemline">along my path</p>
<p class="poemline">to the sea</p>
</div>
