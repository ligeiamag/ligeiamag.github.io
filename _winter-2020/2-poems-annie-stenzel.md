## After thinking long and hard about life on Mars
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I wonder: is it a bit like life</p>
<p class="poemline">on the flood plain of the Truckee River?</p>
<p class="poemline">Because who knows what that is really like?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Oh: so now you tell me it’s akin</p>
<p class="poemline">to being condemned to attend the same</p>
<p class="poemline">scientific swap-meet, day after day.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Well, on Mars, the piano is always slightly</p>
<p class="poemline">out of tune—that’s the heat,</p>
<p class="poemline">the wind, the swirling sand, thanks a bunch.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When a unicorn appeared on the flood plain</p>
<p class="poemline">of the Truckee River there was not a hair out of place!</p>
<p class="poemline">Its single horn was polished to a blinding sheen.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The following day? Another unicorn</p>
<p class="poemline">(or perhaps an encore of the first.)</p>
<p class="poemline">Day three. One more.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Day Four? Who knows.</p>
<p class="poemline">Thank goodness I was groomed</p>
<p class="poemline">and ready for all of this:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Contemplating life on Mars was</p>
<p class="poemline">the only thing that could prepare me</p>
<p class="poemline">for the sight of a unicorn.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And only seeing those unicorns</p>
<p class="poemline">could have prepared me</p>
<p class="poemline">for life on Mars.</p>
</div>

## We look to the ancient Greeks for today’s lesson
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When you seize a grudge and clutch it to your chest</p>
<p class="poemline">what happens next?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Recall the Spartan youth who stole a fox, then, stoic,</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">hid it underneath his cloak and suffered death</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">rather than disclose his misdemeanor? The desperate</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">creature gnawed and clawed the boy’s belly; imagine</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">the wounds. But could the lad have dropped the beast</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">and borne the consequence? Not according to his code.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And thus you carry harm, day in and day out, feeding</p>
<p class="poemline">table-scraps to your destroyer.</p>
</div>
