<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">You were all invited to the gender reveal of my knives.</p>
<p class="poemline">Cake was the only family to attend.</p>
<p class="poemline">I shattered glass terrariums upon personalized placards.</p>
<p class="poemline">Cursed the gods of snacks for taking so long to brand themselves woke.</p>
<p class="poemline">The realtor I hired sent condolences in swathes of corporate regalia.</p>
<p class="poemline">I placed printer cartridges up my urethra to piss contractual smiles.</p>
<p class="poemline">“We’re sorry you feel”, the rest auto-tuned within 24-48 hours.</p>
<p class="poemline">I took advantage of the rented trampoline by learning how to stay fucking put.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The nude who jumped from my hollowed out cake accused escalators of putting stairs out of</p>
<p class="poemline">business.</p>
</div>
