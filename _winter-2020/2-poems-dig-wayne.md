## Fire in the Poetry Hole
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">sitting alone begrudgingly moving your vowels and bowels to dislodge a sorry</p>
<p class="poemline">little rhyme that barely makes a splash.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">but you soldier on</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">a powerful urge takes you over and before you know it, you are at it again, aping</p>
<p class="poemline">Whitman, picking Baldwin’s pockets for precious lint that you attempt to fashion</p>
<p class="poemline">into a brand new silk top hat that will never cover your shortcomings and goings.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">but you soldier on</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">you turn to the bottle to loosen up your guts, maybe roll out a fresh loaf you can</p>
<p class="poemline">pinch a tiny diamond out of, but Charles’ bluebird has flown the coop.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">but you soldier on</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">saddle up a little horse to ride into Kaufman’s lyrical sunset but she bucks and</p>
<p class="poemline">twists, knocks the snot out if you, leaves you flat on your back with a snoot full of</p>
<p class="poemline">hollow.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">but you soldier on</p>
<p class="poemline">you play it square and fair</p>
<p class="poemline">narrow and straight</p>
<p class="poemline">ease on down</p>
<p class="poemline">to the cold morning’s hoarfrost</p>
<p class="poemline">stinging your back bone</p>
<p class="poemline">counting the goose bumps</p>
<p class="poemline">on your chune.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">brave enough</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">to let nature</p>
<p class="poemline">take its course.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">fear not,</p>
<p class="poemline">faith and fiber will bring you joy.</p>
</div>

## All the Traps

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the day is mostly spent lassoing words into a tipped jigsaw puzzle</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">that has no pit-cher guide nor story to paint a pit-cher on or of</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">there is too much to grasp in a lifetime</p>
<p class="poemline">too many connections</p>
<p class="poemline">too many loose ends</p>
<p class="poemline">everything is lyrical</p>
<p class="poemline">everything is not</p>
<p class="poemline">nothing is lyrical</p>
<p class="poemline">nothing is not</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">why didn’t I write about this yesterday</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">because yesterday I was a blind man who</p>
<p class="poemline">thought he could</p>
<p class="poemline">see the mountains from the smell of drunken coyotes squatting above sunset</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">thought he could</p>
<p class="poemline">touch the wind from the blush of shoplifted condoms and horny white chicks</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">thought he could</p>
<p class="poemline">taste the blood of childish rhymes dripping from rare swingin’ monkey bar air</p>
<p class="poemline">guitar geeks</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">thought he could</p>
<p class="poemline">free-style a spitting sharper image but the 80s got in the way of history and</p>
<p class="poemline">histrionics due to the best books being out of finger prints</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">all the traps are sprung</p>
<p class="poemline">set to go</p>
<p class="poemline">all the buckets are full of holes</p>
<p class="poemline">the bullets are blanks</p>
<p class="poemline">the butterflies don’t use a net in the circus</p>
<p class="poemline">and the peanuts are free of charge to children and word stiffs</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the booby prize is immortality for life</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">in the end</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the crows and the grackles will sing a simple song for you while they shit on the</p>
<p class="poemline">head of your statue in the city park</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">it will go something like this</p>
</div>
