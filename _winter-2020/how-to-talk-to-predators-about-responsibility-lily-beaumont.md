<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Did you</p>
<p class="poemline">leave the ashes smoldering</p>
<p class="poemline">the way a god would</p>
<p class="poemline">glide from off the slab</p>
<p class="poemline">of a girl he’s ravished</p>
<p class="poemline">belly full</p>
<p class="poemline">of sleep and meat’s</p>
<p class="poemline">drippings?</p>
