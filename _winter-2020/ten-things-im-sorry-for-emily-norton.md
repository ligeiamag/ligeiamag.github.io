<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">my landlord hearing us fucking/ i haven’t finished a book in months/ i don’t really want to go to</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">thanksgiving dinner/ i don’t really know my brother/ being a dyke/ killing my houseplants/</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">telling my therapist about you/ stepping on my cat’s paw/ sleeping late/ considering this a poem</p>
