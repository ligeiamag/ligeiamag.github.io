<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A wolf, a dentist, and a bear are playing hopscotch on the sidewalk outside of their</p>
<p class="poemline">condominium. They are roommates. They get along well. The wolf likes that the dentist</p>
<p class="poemline">keeps his teeth sharp. Why do you like to keep your teeth sharp? the dentist asked the</p>
<p class="poemline">wolf the first time the wolf asked his services. To scare my landlord off, he’s always</p>
<p class="poemline">bugging me. Who is your landlord? the dentist asked, wondering how a wolf came to</p>
<p class="poemline">have a landlord. The same as yours. That’s how they became roommates. The bear got</p>
<p class="poemline">involved because he is friends with the wolf. Giant sparrows, sequined with lilies and</p>
<p class="poemline">chrysanthemums, geraniums, roses, and hyacinths, made the bear’s hibernation den into</p>
<p class="poemline">their nest. The bear thought he could take them, but he found them too beautiful to</p>
<p class="poemline">disturb. They preferred to nest inside the den because the sun burned their flowers off,</p>
<p class="poemline">and the bear understood that nature often couples loss and wished to help preserve the</p>
<p class="poemline">beautiful things that time subtracts. The bear didn’t like math because he only learned</p>
<p class="poemline">subtraction. Maybe if he learned that math can add or multiply, he would have been the</p>
<p class="poemline">first bear scientist. The bear and the dentist got along so-so. The dentist didn’t like when</p>
<p class="poemline">the bear asked him to sharpen his claws. My file is for teeth, not claws, the dentist</p>
<p class="poemline">always says. The bear always mocks the dentist by making his paws imitate a mouth.</p>
<p class="poemline">Blah, blah, blah, the bear says as he does this. Playing hopscotch, the three of them</p>
<p class="poemline">decided to try a simultaneous hop, as a train. The wolf was the head, the dentist was in</p>
<p class="poemline">the middle, and the bear was the caboose. As they initiated their hop they hopped into</p>
<p class="poemline">the stratosphere, billowed up by the hot wind that sang to them as they ascended. It was</p>
<p class="poemline">summer at this time. All the debris of flowers on the ground ascended with them and</p>
<p class="poemline">fluttered into angels that encircled them as they rose, singing the song the hot wind was</p>
<p class="poemline">singing. When the three entered the stratosphere, they turned into sunshine. Now you</p>
<p class="poemline">will never need your teeth sharpened. Nor you your claws. The sunshine-dentist says to</p>
<p class="poemline">the sunshine-wolf, then to the sunshine-bear. You will never be bothered by your</p>
<p class="poemline">landlord ever again. The sunshine-wolf and -bear say in unison. The only landlord we</p>
<p class="poemline">have now is freedom, and our only responsibility is to shine. That is a bigger</p>
<p class="poemline">responsibility than we have ever had, they realize.</p>
