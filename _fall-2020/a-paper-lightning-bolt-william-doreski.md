<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Someone has tacked a paper cutout</p>
<p class="poemline">of a lightning bolt to the sky.</p>
<p class="poemline">One of those zigzag cartoons</p>
<p class="poemline">that Thor likes to chuck at the earth.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">No, it doesn’t look like real lightning,</p>
<p class="poemline">but I wonder how the cartoonist</p>
<p class="poemline">got it up there, how it’s fastened</p>
<p class="poemline">to the filmy and fickle sky.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">You think it fell from a comet</p>
<p class="poemline">and somehow stuck into place</p>
<p class="poemline">through an obscure natural process</p>
<p class="poemline">science has yet to describe.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">But looking through binoculars</p>
<p class="poemline">I can clearly see that it’s paper</p>
<p class="poemline">rippling in a stratospheric wind.</p>
<p class="poemline">We agree it’s not an omen but</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">perhaps a campaign poster</p>
<p class="poemline">for a candidate running for</p>
<p class="poemline">some minor public office</p>
<p class="poemline">like fence viewer or dog warden.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Other people are looking up.</p>
<p class="poemline">A woman panics, fears the hand</p>
<p class="poemline">of God is working against us.</p>
<p class="poemline">But God doesn’t bother with paper</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">silhouettes when he can wield</p>
<p class="poemline">the real thing with deadly effect.</p>
<p class="poemline">We sip our latte outdoors because</p>
<p class="poemline">the pandemic still prevails.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The first good thunderstorm</p>
<p class="poemline">will pulp that phony lightning bolt</p>
<p class="poemline">in a gust of cosmic laughter</p>
<p class="poemline">we’ll hear even if asleep.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">No one should be worried,</p>
<p class="poemline">but I wonder who owns a ladder</p>
<p class="poemline">tall enough to reach all that sky</p>
<p class="poemline">and whether he’d lend it to me.</p>
</div>
