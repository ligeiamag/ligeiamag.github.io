<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Stirring the neighbors from their beds</p>
<p class="poemline">In a paper-doll chain,</p>
<p class="poemline">The comet descends and displays its wares,</p>
<p class="poemline">Some strung-out peddler</p>
<p class="poemline">Bangs tin on a street cart.</p>
<p class="poemline">Somewhere, a horse trembles in a field,</p>
<p class="poemline">Lit blue by the specter</p>
<p class="poemline">Of death taken cold,</p>
<p class="poemline">Shot through the blood sparkling.</p>
<p class="poemline">Somewhere a chorus</p>
<p class="poemline">Is promised the easy out</p>
<p class="poemline">Of a brand-new apocalypse.</p>
<p class="poemline">And a man holds a child to the window</p>
<p class="poemline">In a city that will</p>
<p class="poemline">Swallow them whole. She will grow old</p>
<p class="poemline">Before she knows what she’s seen,</p>
<p class="poemline">The tail a promise,</p>
<p class="poemline">The container infinity.</p>
</div>
