<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Summer came and went</p>
<p class="poemline">without the expected</p>
<p class="poemline">preponderance of new life</p>
<p class="poemline">forms. We ran against</p>
<p class="poemline">the sun, tried to eat the moon.</p>
<p class="poemline">All we got was seawater</p>
<p class="poemline">and hands that melted</p>
<p class="poemline">every morning only to grow</p>
<p class="poemline">again at sunset.</p>
</div>
