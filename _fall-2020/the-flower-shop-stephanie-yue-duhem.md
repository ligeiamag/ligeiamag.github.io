<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In the coliseum of years,</p>
<p class="poemline">I see him straddling some ruin,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">my Po Po’s brother with the cicada husk eyes.</p>
<p class="poemline">The light through those shells was grey,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">as the light through those shells was grey,</p>
<p class="poemline">too, that dusky December day</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">in Nanking.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A one-star general before he was starred</p>
<p class="poemline">with bullets, Po Po’s brother would have a few</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">good years left when the shells screamed</p>
<p class="poemline">through the city, in unison with</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">men and cicadas, the husky choir</p>
<p class="poemline">of war; he was Po Po’s one</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">male sibling,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the star of their name in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>That time he was saved</em>—lifted from the fire</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">by a girl who desired him through the panes</p>
<p class="poemline">of a flower shop window, he the only</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">man amid petals of ash and dust</p>
<p class="poemline">neither fatal nor wet rust red, yet,</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">the one thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">But now—in the coliseum of years when</p>
<p class="poemline">the light shies away, with his shoddy</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">shell eyes, he can’t tell</p>
<p class="poemline">chrysanthemums in a glass</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">from a glass jar full of tar, or</p>
<p class="poemline">the bullet points of his life from those of</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">his killing.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">He saved only what</p>
<p class="poemline">he was gifted: that</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">he met his wife among flowers,</p>
<p class="poemline">in 1937, in Nanking.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">(Still he</p>
<p class="poemline">hears her</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">beckoning.)</p>
</div>
