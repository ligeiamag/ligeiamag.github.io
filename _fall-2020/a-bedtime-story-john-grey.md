<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I tell my child</p>
<p class="poemline">a bedtime story</p>
<p class="poemline">in which</p>
<p class="poemline">the wise king</p>
<p class="poemline">and munificent queen</p>
<p class="poemline">are burned to</p>
<p class="poemline">a crisp by dragons,</p>
<p class="poemline">the handsome prince</p>
<p class="poemline">is decapitated</p>
<p class="poemline">during sword-fight practice,</p>
<p class="poemline">the beautiful princess</p>
<p class="poemline">dies of the plague</p>
<p class="poemline">and an ogre</p>
<p class="poemline">moves into the castle.</p>
<p class="poemline">My child bursts</p>
<p class="poemline">into tears.</p>
<p class="poemline">He’s upset that</p>
<p class="poemline">I forgot the part</p>
<p class="poemline">where the</p>
<p class="poemline">lovely white horse</p>
<p class="poemline">is eviscerated</p>
<p class="poemline">by trolls.</p>
