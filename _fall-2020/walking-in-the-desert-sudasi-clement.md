<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I remember cool dark tunnels,</p>
<p class="poemline">freshly dug earth cradling us as we slept.</p>
<p class="poemline">I remember my coyote-voice, and the run</p>
<p class="poemline">and the hunt and the hunt-song.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When I was scaled and legless,</p>
<p class="poemline">my tongue was my secret, my prize.</p>
<p class="poemline">When I was a raven I knew bugs</p>
<p class="poemline">and eggs and tricks and twigs.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When I was human it took some</p>
<p class="poemline">getting used to. I crouched on the ground</p>
<p class="poemline">and ate with my hands, howled in cars</p>
<p class="poemline">and growled at strangers.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">But oh, my beautiful thumbs</p>
<p class="poemline">grasped needle and thread, baked</p>
<p class="poemline">cornbread in an iron skillet,</p>
<p class="poemline">planted honeysuckle and thyme.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I gave birth to a boy. Carried him</p>
<p class="poemline">by the scruff of his neck to a burrow,</p>
<p class="poemline">sang to him under a blanket</p>
<p class="poemline">of stars and wind.</p>
</div>
