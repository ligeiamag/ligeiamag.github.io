## The Shark Are All Sharks No Better and No Worse


<p><em>“The sea is the sea. The old man is an old man. The boy is a boy and the fish is a fish. The shark are all sharks no better and no worse. All the symbolism that people say is shit. What goes beyond is what you see beyond when you know.”—Ernest Hemingway</em></p>


<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The farmer told me there were</p>
<p class="poemline">sharks in the wheat field—so I cried.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Still I played with a red dress in black woods</p>
<p class="poemline">though the new stories had real wolves there.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">There has to be something between a monster</p>
<p class="poemline">under the bed and the creature in the middle distance</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">where I can feel safe to rest my head</p>
<p class="poemline">and close my eyes one at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When I disappeared, newspapers called me drowned</p>
<p class="poemline">but I was in that wheat field—</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">flailing arms punching out,</p>
<p class="poemline">fighting and cursing all I couldn’t see.</p>
</div>

## Questionnaire for the End of the World

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Does today look like any other day?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Can you see the horizon?</p>
<p class="poemline">Are sirens sounding in the distance?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Is the horizon red with blood?</p>
<p class="poemline">Have you replaced framed pictures of your loved ones?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Did you replace them with new gods?</p>
<p class="poemline">Have you sheltered in place?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Has your shelter been destroyed by climate change?</p>
<p class="poemline">Did you make peace with what you couldn’t change?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Has what-you-could-change-but-didn’t caught up to you?</p>
<p class="poemline">Did you notify your next-of-kin?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Do you have a mask to prevent the spreading of disease?</p>
<p class="poemline">Are you considered the disease?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Can you hide your face sufficiently with a mask?</p>
<p class="poemline">Can you see the horizon over the mask?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Can you hide your identity with said mask?</p>
<p class="poemline">Did you delete your notions of privacy long ago?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Can you blink in Morse code?</p>
<p class="poemline">Did you scream into the void?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Did the void scream it back?</p>
<p class="poemline">Did you do the Hokey Pokey?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Have you turned yourself around?</p>
<p class="poemline">Do you see a table?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Did you come to the table willingly?</p>
<p class="poemline">Did others tie you to the table for The Ritual?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Have you smashed some throats in?</p>
<p class="poemline">Have you had your throat smashed in?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Have you alerted the police?</p>
<p class="poemline">Did the police turn against you?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Have you become the police to survive?</p>
<p class="poemline">Has the power gone out?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Have you planned for power alternatives?</p>
<p class="poemline">Is power within your grasp?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Does your reach exceed it?</p>
<p class="poemline">Does today look like any other day?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Have you lost hope?</p>
<p class="poemline">Have you lost the idea of hope?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">Have you grown up?</p>
<p class="poemline">Have you given up?</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">If you gave up, can you rally?</p>
