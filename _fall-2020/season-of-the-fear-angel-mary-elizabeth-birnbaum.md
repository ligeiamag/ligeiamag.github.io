<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">I remember when I died,</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">but the two dimensional door</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">that presses your life away</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">also through its sorcery</p>
<p class="poemline">thins your dying. I don’t know. What season</p>
<p class="poemline">was it? There must have been people</p>
<p class="poemline">troubling the street, trees making supplication</p>
<p class="poemline">to clouds for rain. And the grand shout</p>
<p class="poemline">of the sun, which you can depend on</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">every morning when you’re alive.</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">I don’t remember anything</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">but words, <em>knife,</em> but not its physical</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">being, only that it flags death’s</p>
<p class="poemline">entry. <em>Voice, </em>spoken message with no substance,</p>
<p class="poemline">not tenor, not baritone, not whisper or snarl.</p>
<p class="poemline">The fear angel’s dead deadly <em>voice</em> empties you</p>
<p class="poemline">from the clothed red universe, warm, busy,</p>
<p class="poemline">belling with its shining satisfaction.</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">You must row the boat awash</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">with frozen sweat, back</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">through shaken silence. Believe</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">your earth will obey you again. Believe</p>
<p class="poemline">your throat open again, to syllable, to sound.</p>
<p class="poemline">That street accepts your walk’s casual telegraph.</p>
<p class="poemline">Glass in your front door promises to armor you</p>
<p class="poemline">like steel. And a shadow voice tells you again</p>
<p class="poemline">the <em>other</em> door caves</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">between two ribs.</p>
