<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Jennifer picks cherries to make jam</p>
<p class="poemline">and asks me how do you know when you’ve reduced a self</p>
<p class="poemline">to nothing</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I pull the leaves off healthy succulents trying to grow</p>
<p class="poemline">ten imperfections from something that was somehow</p>
<p class="poemline">still alive</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We sprout hummingbird wings fly</p>
<p class="poemline">backwards into Broadway glam fantasies</p>
<p class="poemline">wait</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">It’s too early to be a star</p>
<p class="poemline">(to burn out)—</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I haven’t even had my coffee yet</p>
</div>
