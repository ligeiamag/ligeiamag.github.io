<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">An egret perched on a cow</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent1">watched my uncle ride his horse</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent2">in a gallop as he held the reins</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">with one hand and covered</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent1">his glass eye with the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The hooves left marks on our land,</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent1">imprints of hardened keratin,</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent2">with fresh notes of joy in abundance,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">harvests and enough water</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent1">in the trough to last a century.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">But close to the ground,</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent1">inside the cracks left by those hooves,</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent2">a sense of change when a stranger in uniform</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">stole my uncle’s stallion and taunted him</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent1">by riding the horse in front of him.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Until my uncle’s brother and a friend</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent1">crawled up the mountain in grief</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent2">and fed his horse a poison.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Then neither he nor the stranger</p>
<p class="poemline andres-indent1">could gallop through the mountains.</p>
</div>
