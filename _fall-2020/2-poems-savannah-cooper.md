## Mother Viper

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Autumn shrugs into view, closer</p>
<p class="poemline">skies. A slow and gentle dying.</p>
<p class="poemline">Stacks of Halloween decorations</p>
<p class="poemline">piled in the basement, probably</p>
<p class="poemline">cobwebbed for real now, and I</p>
<p class="poemline">should have bought costumes.</p>
<p class="poemline">I should be sleepless—and I am</p>
<p class="poemline">sometimes, just not in the way</p>
<p class="poemline">I anticipated. Too many nights,</p>
<p class="poemline">I stumble toward unconsciousness</p>
<p class="poemline">and feel afraid, jolt myself awake</p>
<p class="poemline">in a panic because I remember</p>
<p class="poemline">too well the feeling of a body</p>
<p class="poemline">that no longer feels familiar.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">It’s rained all week, and normally</p>
<p class="poemline">I love the gray, the patter of drops</p>
<p class="poemline">against the aluminum siding,</p>
<p class="poemline">the way they echo like a song</p>
<p class="poemline">in the fireplace. But these days,</p>
<p class="poemline">the sky feels too heavy, the air</p>
<p class="poemline">too thick. I could suffocate on it,</p>
<p class="poemline">and the thought is deep and old,</p>
<p class="poemline">yanks me back to second grade</p>
<p class="poemline">and a baptism I didn’t want,</p>
<p class="poemline">the water swallowing the light,</p>
<p class="poemline">a crowd of people below clapping</p>
<p class="poemline">and me pressing my nose closed</p>
<p class="poemline">with the desperation of the dying.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I don’t have it in me to tell anyone</p>
<p class="poemline">that there is no next time, that I can’t</p>
<p class="poemline">walk that road again, feel my body</p>
<p class="poemline">drift away, feel another body torn</p>
<p class="poemline">from mine, swollen and already gone.</p>
<p class="poemline">There is no cure. I’ll let my days</p>
<p class="poemline">waste away, every poem touching</p>
<p class="poemline">the same bruise, pressing it.</p>
<p class="poemline">What is left but this? Who am I</p>
<p class="poemline">but this—wrecked, weary,</p>
<p class="poemline">venomous as the day is long.</p>
<p class="poemline">I should be golden-eyed and wild,</p>
<p class="poemline">curled in wait. Instead I watch the world</p>
<p class="poemline">pass, bare fangs at my own reflection.</p>

## Everything Is Significant Until Further Notice

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The pale gray cast of the sky, the wide</p>
<p class="poemline">blankness just before snowfall. The ticking</p>
<p class="poemline">of the two wristwatches on the counter,</p>
<p class="poemline">never quite in sync. She came home</p>
<p class="poemline">yesterday, stood her boots in the corner</p>
<p class="poemline">of the bedroom. The cat tried to climb</p>
<p class="poemline">into the left one, knocked it over,</p>
<p class="poemline">and now it lies there like a dead fish—</p>
<p class="poemline">shiny and still.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Three drinks in, and nothing has changed,</p>
<p class="poemline">except her cadence. A video played</p>
<p class="poemline">on the laptop on the table, the resolution</p>
<p class="poemline">poor, faces blurred, colors messy.</p>
<p class="poemline">A ring glistened in the wood, residue</p>
<p class="poemline">from an old drink, a glass now broken.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The snag on the elbow of her sweater.</p>
<p class="poemline">The catch in her voice on the word</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>yesterday</em>. She fell asleep on the couch,</p>
<p class="poemline">a striped throw pillow crushed</p>
<p class="poemline">in her arms, flecks of mascara caught</p>
<p class="poemline">in the half-moons beneath her eyes.</p>
</div>
