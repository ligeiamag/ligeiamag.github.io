*O uncommonly sunny death . . .*

---from "Meltwater" p. 13

<br>

Six thirty pm. It's high spring in Baltimore. Everything smells of wet
earth and foliage. A crowd is gathered in the back garden of The Ivy
Bookshop, reading and discussing poetry. The group is spread out across
the grass on colorful chairs and wooden benches and gingham picnic
blankets. The sun is beginning to dip towards the highway, casting
golden light over upturned faces. At the center of it all, three large
hedges, deep green, resembling a high-backed throne of peacock feathers,
frame a pair of readers. The scene is gorgeous. It's borderline
mythical. It feels all too picturesque for the conversation at hand:
childbearing in a time of climate crisis. It is April 12, the day of The
Ivy's first Poets in the Gardens event and about a month after the
publication of Claire Wahmanholm's third full collection, titled
*Meltwater* (Milkweed Editions, 2023).

I wanted to begin with this ethereal (and perhaps a bit purple) snapshot
of Claire Wahmanholm in conversation with Edgar Kunz because to talk
about *Meltwater* is to talk about our place in nature. Despite the
blessedly unseasonable warmth, the joy of community, and all the newly
hatched bugs flaunting their shimmering multitude in beams of sunlight,
the evening took on an unshakable chill in our sharing of these poems,
which serve as reminders that we are not separate from the natural
world, but an increasingly devastating part of it---

<br>

*There used*\\
*to be so many rabbits*, we say to the child\\
as we move the shadow rabbits back and\\
forth before the firelight. *We used to kill*\\
*them like they were nothing* . . .

---from "More Rabbits"

<br>

In a similar vein to Wahmanholm's previous books, *Redmouth* and
*Wilder*, *Meltwater* acts as a sort of fable of the future. Children
cut out paper animals as they listen to stories of such long extinct
species as bees and rabbits; people have learned to pull their limbs off
for survival; "the only kind of fruit we can still name" are grenades;
travelers buy luxury cruise tickets to glimpse the world's last iceberg,
to collect a vial of its precious meltwater, and they are disappointed
by what they experience. What is perhaps most unsettling about these
stories is that they are based squarely in reality. Despite its terrible
beauty, *Meltwater* is not a fantasy. It is grounded in its strangeness,
extrapolating out our possible future from the very real actions (and
inactions) of today's human population. In these poems, Wahmanholm
constructs, line by dripping line, the narrative of a world that is at
once brutal and astonishingly banal.

In short, this collection cascades over the shoulders in a shock of
cold, clean truth.

Despite this hyper-awareness, this gnawing desire to numb oneself to
such realities as habitat destruction and the loss of bodily autonomy,
it isn't all doom and gloom in Wahmanholm's work. After all, to focus
too intently on the apocalypse would be to miss all the wonders.
Likewise, to put too much emphasis on the governing body of fear is to
overlook the collection's true center: the next generation, those who
will inherit the collapse. From epistolary poems directed toward a
developing embryo, to cautionary tales, to poems named for letters of
the alphabet ("M is for metamorphosis," "O is for / opus," "Once P is
for plastic, it is always / for plastic"), there is a particular levity
that infects the collection in spite of its dystopian tendencies. For
instance, the hauntingly titled "You Will Soon Enter a Land Where
Everything Will Try to Kill You" is a recognition that, yes, we are
likely leaving a worse world for those children we so selfishly keep
having, but it is also a poem indicative of growth, of wanting to
instill better values into those children, of moving past the desire to
cause undue harm---

<br>

In the world's rich dirt\\
I could have planted brambles, clovers. I could have just loved\\
the earth instead of inventing new ways to hurt (p. 8)

<br>

When Wahmanholm read this poem in full at The Ivy, she introduced it
with a sort of chuckle at the title, and laughter rippled quietly
through the audience in turn. The sentiment is not an uncommon one. She
very candidly shared her experiences of pregnancy, giving birth, and
raising a young daughter in a post-Trump, post-Roe America, the
multi-dimensional fears tied up in an already fraught process. In this
regard, "You will Soon Enter..." in particular stands out, illustrating
the way a parent's joy is colored by remorse. The tone is pensive and
achingly apologetic. It so clearly takes place on the precipice of
destruction, but, though the speaker is afraid, she nonetheless looks
out past the edge to see the beauty beyond the leap.

An especially interesting feature looming large in the waters of the
collection is a disjointed series of poems all titled "Meltwater." These
are erasures that indeed appear melt down the page. They are sculpted
from Lacy M. Johnson's 2019 *New Yorker* article, "[How to Mourn A
Glacier](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-to-mourn-a-glacier){:target="_blank"},"
a piece illustrating the memorial ceremony for Okj√∂kull, the first
Icelandic glacier to lose its status, a "dead glacier." However, I
hesitate to use the term "erasure" as it does not encapsulate all that
these poems convey. In fact, Wahmanholm herself expressed some
discomfort over the designation, asking reading attendees to suggest
suitable replacement terms, claiming that these poems, published with
the permission of the essay's author, do not *erase* the original work,
but rather *focus* it, providing a lens through which to read it. And
what is this lens? It is summed up most succinctly in the following
selected lines from the fourth "Meltwater" poem:

<br>

O ice cap in the shape of // all / the / lessons // we // wanted to //
learn // but // didn't

<br>

If the collection as a whole is a look towards the future, the Meltwater
poems turn our gaze backwards, towards the "ice \[that\] stretches
between us and history." They are explorations of time and memory,
imploring readers to learn from the mistakes of their ancestors in order
to fashion a livable, sustainable future out of what has not yet
disappeared.

*Meltwater* dances both with the abundances and the anxieties of our
time, and it does so with practiced steps. Wahmanholm so skillfully
probes the issue of human-led annihilation, but she also taps into the
potential for redemption, pulling her readers "away from their own warm
worlds" and inviting them into a world of limitless entanglements.

*Meltwater* is available now from [Milkweed
Editions](https://milkweed.org/book/meltwater){:target="_blank"}.
