<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">See that white butterfly right there, that one, pieris rapae</p>
<p class="poemline">perched on the rose bush to pray before gliding over gladiolas?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I want to tell you that’s my Avó come to visit, remind me</p>
<p class="poemline">that life is suffering and skirmish and strolls through a garden</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">girdled with beauty. I want to convince you that the dead come back</p>
<p class="poemline">to watch our back, keep us from stepping in shit twice. With a flick</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of its wings, these bug-ghosts save us every day from ourselves.</p>
<p class="poemline">Don’t you know? Oh, forget it. Forget my wild beliefs and tenuous truths.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Two sweet pups sleep on the couch, cuddled together in a bundle</p>
<p class="poemline">of fur, the youngest flat on the floor, tongue out like red carpet.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">These things you know, you see, you understand.</p>
</div>
