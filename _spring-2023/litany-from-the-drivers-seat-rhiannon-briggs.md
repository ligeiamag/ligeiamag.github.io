<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When I was fifteen I learned, from the passenger</p>
<p class="poemline">seat of an interchangeable Toyota,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">that driving was a game you could win</p>
<p class="poemline">if you never stopped. Since then I had become</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">a secondary vehicle, rarely pushing thirty</p>
<p class="poemline">on a residential. But the night I remembered</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the game of not stopping I didn’t sleep, just tore</p>
<p class="poemline">my eyes open to the road and my left hand</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">through the air like I knew where the highway</p>
<p class="poemline">stopped and the sky began.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Now I am all the silent motion; the slow</p>
<p class="poemline">and the fast; the constant; the fingers tracing</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the wind; the wind tracing the fingers; I am</p>
<p class="poemline">the crystallized remnants of speed scattered</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">among the smell of burnt rubber; I am the expanding</p>
<p class="poemline">of the suburbs, the crawling of the commute,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and the California stop; I am the squirrel</p>
<p class="poemline">running across the road and the crow</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">flying from under the wheel; I am always</p>
<p class="poemline">here; I am the steady death of the deer</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">off the shoulder; I am the lonely pace of life</p>
<p class="poemline">and that massive earthly falling after.</p>
</div>
