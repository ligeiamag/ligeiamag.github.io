<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little red pill sends thick drug commands to lodge in my fore-</p>
<p class="poemline">arms, the street-pressed PCP we came by dishonestly first blowing up</p>
<p class="poemline">on me while I’m out walking . . .</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my arms have thought waves coming off them, my pelvis</p>
<p class="poemline">in forward tilt wound by cables of force proper that hold me in a new</p>
<p class="poemline">place where I fit snugly: the whole universe. Look at these new greens</p>
<p class="poemline">of spring under the streetlights!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took in a couple of midnight shows, werewolf movies of the</p>
<p class="poemline">time, thusly bent, my friend’s voice booming in the darkened theater, “I</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>SUGGEST YOU TAKE THIS OTHER HALF,” as he drops something small</em></p>
<p class="poemline">into my upraised palm—why, it’s a little pill, a half-pill, a pill part. I should</p>
<p class="poemline">do as instructed.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These movies are dull stuff, nothing happening on the screen, tiny</p>
<p class="poemline">like television, but the theater bathroom is huge, irresistibly yellow, the</p>
<p class="poemline">urinals something from the future, the future of urination to enjoy now,</p>
<p class="poemline">really let go! Future now, then slowly, look how slowly I am walking.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The film ends? We attempt to leave, but a very big dog is circling</p>
<p class="poemline">our Beetle in the parking lot, the only car left, the dog is as big as the car</p>
<p class="poemline">itself and we cannot approach the car because we’re very high and afraid</p>
<p class="poemline">the animal is some were-beast loosed from the film, come to kill us</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for guzzling beer smuggled into the theater, for dropping street-</p>
<p class="poemline">pressed shit, for leading dissolute lives, for not paying attention to The</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>Howling right in front of us, or American Werewolf in London.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got lost in the endless yellow bathroom, I was flat up against the</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>pons asinorum of my hypertrophic love, aroar atilt and aclutter, I plead</em></p>
<p class="poemline">the discombobulation endemic to daily minor turpitude, I haven’t eaten</p>
<p class="poemline">anything since yesterday, we weren’t trying to ignore you.</p>
</div>
