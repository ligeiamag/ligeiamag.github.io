## How it Goes Down
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Swimmingly, I fall into it—</p>
<p class="poemline">the vegetable cooperation</p>
<p class="poemline">of light and labor.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Useful in a way</p>
<p class="poemline">that shouldn’t be paid for,</p>
<p class="poemline">and I know it. I know it.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Yet, I can’t decide if it is a decision,</p>
<p class="poemline">being drugged through the day</p>
<p class="poemline">or rubbed against it like sandpaper,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">undiagnosed. I know</p>
<p class="poemline">the root: fear that migrates</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">into every joint</p>
<p class="poemline">and organ, striking like</p>
<p class="poemline">baby cobras let loose</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">in a circus tent. Too many</p>
<p class="poemline">people needing to unearth.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I volunteer to warm up</p>
<p class="poemline">to the idea of snapping this body</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">like a twig—tossing it off</p>
<p class="poemline">to the fields for the leaf rot</p>
<p class="poemline">and clover to feed or eat what I am.</p>
</div>

## At Other Volumes and Speeds
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Raining a little, a light mist.</p>
<p class="poemline">I almost walk, not run, right past</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">a tree with a mouth, wide</p>
<p class="poemline">as a toothless monster—</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">a site I must’ve passed</p>
<p class="poemline">many times before.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I do not go inside it. Not</p>
<p class="poemline">with my head or hands. Yet,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">all around it, so many emptied</p>
<p class="poemline">packs of cigarettes.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I could count them or call them</p>
<p class="poemline">leaf, leaf, leaf.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Now, distant and all around me,</p>
<p class="poemline">starts the dizzying hum</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of those on their way. I imagine</p>
<p class="poemline">a silhouette of bodies,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">fidgeting in coffee lines, full</p>
<p class="poemline">of love and outer space,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">as I stare into it</p>
<p class="poemline">that moss-lipped abyss,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">as if it could</p>
<p class="poemline">tell me what to do</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">with my life,</p>
<p class="poemline">and it does.</p>
</div>

## Boat With a River
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I make my bed almost every morning,</p>
<p class="poemline">but not every morning.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Some mornings, I feel the river less</p>
<p class="poemline">than gentle, push me more swiftly</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">downstream. Now, I am a clump of oak-brown</p>
<p class="poemline">leaves, a boat for damsel flies, and spiders.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">*</p>
<p class="poemline">Another man across the street has died.</p>
<p class="poemline">A young couple with one dog and one child,</p>
<p class="poemline">stands where he is and is no more.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">They look over at me,</p>
<p class="poemline">the third eldest neighbor now, and wave.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">*</p>
<p class="poemline">Last night, I dreamed my pinky finger,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">curling now was straight again.</p>
<p class="poemline">I dipped it, dipstick-like, into the river</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">to touch the spine of a crawdad.</p>
<p class="poemline">My whole body went cold then</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">warm again, and my face, leaning in</p>
<p class="poemline">to see it, became the river too.</p>
</div>
