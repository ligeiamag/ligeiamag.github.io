<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">These days the wind blows differently. The kind of wind that makes me want to write how</p>
<p class="poemline">strange it is. But I can’t write anything about it. I don’t know its shape, its ripeness, nor the way</p>
<p class="poemline">it slopes, only the damage it leaves. There it rebels in the vegetation, doing what the wind</p>
<p class="poemline">sometimes does, whistling tiny grasses into more tiny grasses, tearing apart space to fronds,</p>
<p class="poemline">almost like fear. I can say this because I live in a country that acts as a crossing for typhoons. I</p>
<p class="poemline">remember when the strongest typhoon hit us, my little sister curled up in a corner and screamed</p>
<p class="poemline">in a shrill mix of horror and protest at the wind as it tried to uproot our house—uproot us all,</p>
<p class="poemline">sweep everything away with it, like a dream sequence in a darker interpretation of Oz. A tragedy</p>
<p class="poemline">we had to overcome and most especially had to laugh at, as everyone expects, as if we just didn’t</p>
<p class="poemline">experience the supernatural. Cold and strange wind. This trade wind became our trademark. A</p>
<p class="poemline">racial identity. It can tell our history, I feel, that I could finally write about and mourn our long</p>
<p class="poemline">periods of fourfold colonialism. But I don’t, or I tried to. Or I still can’t refuse the silence. Can’t</p>
<p class="poemline">avoid its touch. Instead I stay and listen. The wind howls beyond recognition.</p>
