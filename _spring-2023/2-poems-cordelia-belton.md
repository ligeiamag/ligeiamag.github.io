<p class="poemline">I am no contract</p>
<p class="poemline">I am mammalian</p>
<p class="poemline">which means ears and mammaries</p>
<p class="poemline">and there are other stipulations</p>
<p class="poemline">I fail to meet those</p>
<p class="poemline">so I’m in the envelope</p>
<p class="poemline">to provide your receipts</p>
