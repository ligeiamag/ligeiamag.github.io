<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The rain checks of May give way</p>
<p class="poemline">to harsher things. I sleep to the sounds</p>
<p class="poemline">of waves hitting the coast despite the fact</p>
<p class="poemline">that there are no rocks here, and no</p>
<p class="poemline">waves, and no coast. I count every second</p>
<p class="poemline">with a half-shekel and stuff my hands</p>
<p class="poemline">into empty pockets. I wait for something more.</p>
<p class="poemline">The far woods creep in; so do the demons</p>
<p class="poemline">with chicken feet; so does the voice of heaven</p>
<p class="poemline">going, “And <em>what</em> are you waiting for?”</p>
<p class="poemline">Every fox I see, I laugh, but it does</p>
<p class="poemline">no good. Every fox I see stands on</p>
<p class="poemline">ruin. And what <em>am</em> I waiting for? At some point</p>
<p class="poemline">the sun stops feeling warm, and just feels</p>
<p class="poemline">like sun. I can’t find it in me</p>
<p class="poemline">to worry about my hair. The crickets and cicadas</p>
<p class="poemline">and June bugs sleep under my bed,</p>
<p class="poemline">and I invite them to cuddle with me. I’ve</p>
<p class="poemline">imagined throwing myself from rooftops</p>
<p class="poemline">but there are none from which to be thrown. I’ve wondered</p>
<p class="poemline">how it would feel to burn my hands</p>
<p class="poemline">and discovered it is a sharper pain than I would have</p>
<p class="poemline">thought. I remember the mornings I dragged myself</p>
<p class="poemline">from bed, crawling head-down to meet</p>
<p class="poemline">the sun outside, and the first time I realized</p>
<p class="poemline">I didn’t have to. Every excuse I’ve made</p>
<p class="poemline">for leaving rotting food out, and every way</p>
<p class="poemline">I’ve disappeared. It started long ago, this fuzziness</p>
<p class="poemline">in my head. I could have seen it coming</p>
<p class="poemline">but I wanted it to come.</p>
