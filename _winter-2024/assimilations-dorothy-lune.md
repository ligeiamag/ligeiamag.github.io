<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In a public display of affection</p>
<p class="poemline">I serenade a milk carton, I am a</p>
<p class="poemline">hollow honeyeater who can collapse</p>
<p class="poemline">internally. Pink fungi grows in</p>
<p class="poemline">my neighbor’s gable canopy—</p>
<p class="poemline">this is met with frustration when</p>
<p class="poemline">this expects a kind greeting. In a</p>
<p class="poemline">public appraisal of day I move one</p>
<p class="poemline">square inch at a time in any</p>
<p class="poemline">direction, I am a king who rules</p>
<p class="poemline">over my mother’s retired &</p>
<p class="poemline">mystical ashtrays. Glitter in carpets</p>
<p class="poemline">look like meth, brightening &</p>
<p class="poemline">blinding components—blind</p>
<p class="poemline">oneself from much to see or miss,</p>
<p class="poemline">love or observe. Brighten the</p>
<p class="poemline">dingy trap house my father couch</p>
<p class="poemline">surfs to avoid god, knows what.</p>
<p class="poemline">In a private display of curiosity—</p>
<p class="poemline">I ask God about what he’s</p>
<p class="poemline">up to, & if God would</p>
<p class="poemline">help, or if God is like the log lady</p>
<p class="poemline">& can only hold so much. In</p>
<p class="poemline">a private display I slather myself</p>
<p class="poemline">in solid sunset, I am not</p>
<p class="poemline">manufactured, I’m not two</p>
<p class="poemline">or more bodies nor can I</p>
<p class="poemline">travel far distances fast—I am</p>
<p class="poemline">not reinventing the wheel,</p>
<p class="poemline">my neighbors will call the police</p>
<p class="poemline">on me for that noise. I ask</p>
<p class="poemline">God for a Christianity to keep me</p>
<p class="poemline">away from meth without</p>
<p class="poemline">the colonization of my mouth to</p>
<p class="poemline">collapse it into the shape of</p>
<p class="poemline">a gable roof, stapled on for my</p>
<p class="poemline">neighbors delight in my smell.</p>
