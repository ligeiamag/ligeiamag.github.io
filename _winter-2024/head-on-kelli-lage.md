<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My husband doesn’t want to talk</p>
<p class="poemline">about coffins and why my childhood</p>
<p class="poemline">dog doesn’t have one.</p>
<p class="poemline">He says he’s just trying to not get hit</p>
<p class="poemline">head on</p>
<p class="poemline">and I should be looking in the same</p>
<p class="poemline">direction as him.</p>
<p class="poemline">I play along.</p>
<p class="poemline">But drumming still lives in my stomach.</p>
<p class="poemline">Even after feasts.</p>
<p class="poemline">Even after miracles.</p>
