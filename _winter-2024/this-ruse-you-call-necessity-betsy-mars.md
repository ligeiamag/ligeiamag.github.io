<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>after Advice to Myself by Louise Erdrich</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The baby teeth are intermingled,</p>
<p class="poemline">my addled brain not thinking to keep them separated.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">After the Tooth Fairy came and went,</p>
<p class="poemline">what was left was lost babyhood and a sham</p>
<p class="poemline">perpetuated that I was prepared for motherhood,</p>
<p class="poemline">or even the role of wife.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I failed as the knife rusted</p>
<p class="poemline">and the wooden spoons splintered</p>
<p class="poemline">after a trip through the dishwasher</p>
<p class="poemline">that I <em>should have</em> known to avoid</p>
<p class="poemline">if I was half-equipped for kitchen duty</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">or any kind of domestic chore</p>
<p class="poemline">that my father handled with such aplomb,</p>
<p class="poemline">while my mother wept or swept</p>
<p class="poemline">or spread the bedcovers and her gloom.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">What did I know of strife kept behind closed doors?</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>Such a wife was my father’s undoing</em>, I thought;</p>
<p class="poemline">she left him no choice but to stray.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">So I learned from nothing,</p>
<p class="poemline">slipped through every inauthentic day-to-day,</p>
<p class="poemline">maintained the illusion that I could perform</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the role by cleaning out the crisper,</p>
<p class="poemline">washing the brushes weekly in bleach,</p>
<p class="poemline">keeping up with the papers,</p>
<p class="poemline">placing the last puzzle piece,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">thereby appeasing the God of Immaculate Order,</p>
<p class="poemline">High Priestess of Maternal Failure.</p>
</div>
