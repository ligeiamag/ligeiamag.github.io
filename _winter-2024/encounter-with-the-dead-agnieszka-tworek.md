<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The convoy of my dead passes by</p>
<p class="poemline">while I waltz among the trees to stay warm.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Their faces glare at me</p>
<p class="poemline">like rooms emptied of all furniture.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I kneel, touch the snow and the black patches of earth,</p>
<p class="poemline">play this makeshift piano with my frozen fingers.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The dead stop to listen.</p>
<p class="poemline">The ice on their skin creases and breaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The silence of the clouds fills my ears,</p>
<p class="poemline">so their voices do not reach me.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I gesture: Stay.</p>
<p class="poemline">They shake their translucent heads.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The sky opens its lonely eyelid</p>
<p class="poemline">and invites me in for the evening.</p>
</div>
