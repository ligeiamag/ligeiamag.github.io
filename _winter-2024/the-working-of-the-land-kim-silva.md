<p class="poemline">Giggling children hold hands, rush along in a winding whip, hair stuck to hot brows, pink</p>
<p class="poemline">tongues like the innocent stamens of flowers, like the chameleon’s tail, like the eye stalks of</p>
<p class="poemline">snails, the mother’s burning flesh smothers the dance, legs buckling and blistered feet, the</p>
<p class="poemline">confused children turn their faces to her, their jaws working and they’re hungry, but the mother’s</p>
<p class="poemline">breasts make poisoned milk; she is the grass, they have drilled her green body until a crack</p>
<p class="poemline">opened and roots entangle the children, they rake them with their bitten fingers, it’s dark and</p>
<p class="poemline">empty and smells like coal, like oil; oh, mother earth pierced by many losses, her children have</p>
<p class="poemline">become flaming ghosts and the crack closes up like a drugged mother turning over and whatever</p>
<p class="poemline">animals are left litter the bare land and the coughing of children below becomes the earth’s new</p>
<p class="poemline">music.</p>
