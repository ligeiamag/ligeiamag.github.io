## Quick Study of the Antique Doll

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">There’s nothing brittle of you</p>
<p class="poemline">but your face with its hairline crack</p>
<p class="poemline">along the bridge of your nose.</p>
<p class="poemline">And those gray, glassy eyes that stared</p>
<p class="poemline">down the postal carrier and the dog walkers</p>
<p class="poemline">from the wicker carriage on the porch.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">O! doll of the horror movies I tried</p>
<p class="poemline">to avoid, restrained, your rubber limbs</p>
<p class="poemline">turning viscid and orange—here, I am</p>
<p class="poemline">dissecting you.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Under the fabric, nestled in</p>
<p class="poemline">the wool innards, that which</p>
<p class="poemline">once cried. It sits on the counter, shiny</p>
<p class="poemline">but mute, beside you, a hole in your belly</p>
<p class="poemline">perfect as the circles we'd press</p>
<p class="poemline">from a slab of dough and then</p>
<p class="poemline">bake and then eat, like that.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I could fill you with jam</p>
<p class="poemline">and sew you back up—little stitches</p>
<p class="poemline">like what he pulled from my wrist</p>
<p class="poemline">late that morning.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Your hair is flattened</p>
<p class="poemline">and matted</p>
<p class="poemline">and ash blonde.</p>
<p class="poemline">Your top lip red.</p>
<p class="poemline">The bottom worn away.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Your blue corduroy coat</p>
<p class="poemline">has stains the color of bitter tea</p>
<p class="poemline">and your one pink shoe—your one pink shoe</p>
<p class="poemline">never stays on.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Once, you were lovingly walked.</p>
<p class="poemline">There was perambulation.</p>
<p class="poemline">Your head kept warm</p>
<p class="poemline">with your matching blue cap.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Now, you’re nothing</p>
<p class="poemline">anyone wants, even for free.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Blotch on your left temple.</p>
<p class="poemline">Battered knees.</p>
</div>

## Re: Food Poisoning

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">What we ate near or on large bodies</p>
<p class="poemline">of water ransacked. Even if we could</p>
<p class="poemline">lie down on the narrow bed, it wasn’t</p>
<p class="poemline">for long, having to then make our way</p>
<p class="poemline">to brighter, harder places. To lean.</p>
<p class="poemline">To rid ourselves of what swung and</p>
<p class="poemline">rose and wrecked. What if we were</p>
<p class="poemline">found with our cheek pressed to</p>
<p class="poemline">the cool tile, saying little, honestly</p>
<p class="poemline">nothing—having withdrawn in-</p>
<p class="poemline">ward to where all sounds sounded</p>
<p class="poemline">dim and muffled? Others slept.</p>
<p class="poemline">Silly: those hours before, thinking</p>
<p class="poemline">all would be well. This passage.</p>
<p class="poemline">This bitter hollowing we were</p>
<p class="poemline">insensible to.<em></em></p>
</div>
