One day, when I was trapped inside for too long, I was itching to run.
It had been raining steadily, but at the first sign of a break, I took
off. Less than a mile in, the rain resumed. I looked up at the gray sky,
felt the droplets slide down my cheeks, and laughed. My arms stretched
outwards by their own volition, reaching for something unknown, and I
continued to run as my clothes began to stick to my skin, as the
pavement glistened like it had been greased. Perhaps these spring rains
had come to wash what once was and make it clean.

The road I took sloped down and I slowed my steps, attempting not to
slip. My feet kept themselves rooted even as my running shoes grew damp,
and in this memory I am upright, but here I have been slipping, over and
over. I think about these words, the you that is me and the you that is
someone else, and I believe if I cannot slip in my present moments then
at least I can here on the page. So I will write about you but the you
may also be me. The curiosity of writing this emerges in the untangling.

Splashing in the pool behind my house. Tapping my small fingers on piano
keys. Writing single chapters of novels that plagiarized my favorite
shows. Playing make-believe games or with tadpoles in the water.
Rollerblading along my driveway or tainting my fingers with chalk. The
most distinct memories of my childhood are mere flashes.

I may not remember much, but I remember always wanting to climb trees,
to be larger than myself---to find something larger than myself. Always
looking out, always looking up, always looking around. And I never
wanted to be found. Now I sit on the ground and write sad poems and look
straight ahead, too far ahead, wanting what's ahead. Maybe I should
climb a tree.

A few days ago, I swung on a swing set and let my feet test the dirt
beneath me. I've heard some say this is the practice of grounding,
connecting with mother earth, but I know only one mother, my mother, and
she grows vegetables in the summer. I wonder if this is what grounding
can mean. I remember creating dance routines with friends before I
studied the art form, utilizing damp grass, bare feet, wide backyards. I
wonder if this practice of grounding may now provide a sense of freedom,
that childlike urge to dance. I only need to find an open patch of
grass, shed my shoes, and move without the fear of slipping---unless
this is grounding.

You remember the days when you had long hair and how that must not be
you. You consider the fact that the person you once were is a person
you'll never know, but your parents, your elders, do. What an existence
to live in a place that you can't remember but others can. Now your
friends look at your short hair and ask, Did you ever have it long? and
you show them pictures from middle school, a family trip to Bar Harbor,
Maine. You grow it out now to see if you'll discover new versions of
yourself with each length. Then you try to remember how the town got its
name, how Bar Harbor connects to Bar Island, only seen at low tide, and
there was a day when your feet took that path, but it's hazy around the
edges, which diverts your attention, and now you're stuck thinking about
how long your hair has grown.

Corn stalks across corn fields, trimmed low from recent harvest,
surrounded my sister and I's leisurely bike ride one summer night. The
topic of conversation eludes me now, but I remember her words.

I wish you would talk about yourself more, she said. I wish you would
tell people about your accomplishments. Why don't you tell them you've
written a book?

I can't recall my reaction. Maybe I shrugged. Maybe I stared at the
gravel rolling underneath my tires. They don't ask because they don't
know, I responded. And I don't know how to speak without first having
permission.

This isn't the truth of what I said, but the idea is the same. I have
never been one to share without first being welcomed to it. I admire
those who can, but I cannot exude the same confidence.

I wrestle with this, now, as I write. To offer so much of myself that no
one asked for. I am more comfortable with fiction, the commonly
fictionalized, the safe distance between my life and the words I string
together. So what do I share, here, as my sister asks?

My legal name is Grace, but I often cringe to hear it aloud. I hardly
correct people, but Gracie fits much better, like a right-sized coat.
When I was three, I went to the hospital with pneumonia. On the
ambulance ride that transitioned me from a local hospital to a larger
one in Baltimore, I screamed and pulled an IV needle out of my arm
without settling until an EMT blew up a glove like a balloon. I danced
the part of Snow Queen in *The Nutcracker* in a high-school ballet
production after having half of my toenail removed from a subungual
hematoma due to dancing *en pointe*. My favorite color is blue and I go
on runs with my dog in the summer.

This is what my sister meant, right?

Recently, I drove near a reservoir, my eyes cutting glances between the
road and the landscape of the water. I've driven here many times in the
past year we've been apart, but suddenly a memory came: us, driving with
the tabby cat wailing in the carrier on my lap. I found her a few days
prior and was determined to find her family. I thought my mind had
imagined a meowing in the walls until I saw her outside, three stories
down from my balcony, perusing in the bushes with a feline grace. When
we pulled into the driveway, you tried to comfort me and I tried not to
cry. I held the carrier to my chest with white knuckles. Later, in one
single moment, the carrier transferred from my hands to another's and
she was gone. Silent tears wet the clinical fabric of the mask I wore.
The wails faded, and the carrier, empty this time, was given back to me.
I looked down at its bareness. In a few days, I would listen to a missed
voicemail and learn that the shelter had found her home, her real home,
not the makeshift one I had created. Back in the car, you let me cry and
didn't judge me for it. You were a steady presence, even though you
barely knew me. You asked questions, made lighthearted jokes, held my
hand. I pulled my legs up onto the seat, hugged them, and slid down like
a slow, meticulous sinking into sand.

My sister and I have a habit of saying "sister" when others find it more
interesting to hear "twin." We are not carbon copies, twin flames,
mirrored souls. I am unsure of the meaning of soulmates in a
spiritualistic ideology, but I do wonder if our two halves put together
make a whole. Like high and low tide pulled by the moon and sun's
gravitational forces, interconnected and working in tandem, but unique
parts of the Sol star system.

Our older brother, when my sister and I shared our mother's womb, wanted
to name us Annie and Clarabel after the *Thomas the Tank Engine* books.
Much to his disappointment, my mother decided against it. We were
preemies, underweight but healthy, born less than a week from Christmas
and given middle names---Noelle and Joy---appropriate to the time.

In a few months, my sister is getting married and it will be the first
time we'll be apart, really apart, not just separated by a few weeks
before coming back together. I imagine myself, on her wedding day, as a
father giving her away, because if anyone is being cleaved apart, it's
me, thinking of the days we shared in my mother's womb and how you
cannot become closer to another quite like this.

I have been considering why I write about you. I have begun to wrestle
with wanting to write you out of this narrative and yet continuing to
see more memories arise. *Write about something else*. I see you as a
device to enter into other thoughts, other memories. But what if you are
the through-line, the focus, the place where these moments converge?
What if I don't want you to be? *Write about something else*.

When I was a toddler, I used to eat whole Celebrity tomatoes while
sitting on my grandfather's stationary tractor. There's an old
photograph that froze the moment, so I know it's real. The tomatoes came
from my grandparents' garden, and my siblings and I would process them
down with their help to create a sauce. We were all covered in juice by
the end, my grandfather's white shirt stained soft red as
proof---another photograph. I would not be able to describe this moment
without them. My memory has released these places of my past.

I have become accustomed to saying goodbye to much, but not to my
grandfather. Often I think of his absence, and it jars me to the reality
that he is no longer here and I begin down a panic of time, how it
passes without my approval, how the joyful memories of where he used to
be is a place hard to find.

I haven't figured out how to write about him. I worry that after these
words are written, it will be confirmation he is gone.

I have a growing fear of letting go of my dreams. I realize I am young
and little can come to fruition all at once. I don't want to lose
anything that has been part of me, even if in thought alone, for I fear
what may follow if those suitcases are packed and sent off.

This isn't the end---this is just the beginning, my mom wrote to me as I
neared graduation. Don't be afraid to chase your passions. And so I
will. I will chase until these feet falter. They have yet to grow weary,
and so I have yet to stop.

Can you grieve something before its end? Before even an inclination that
it may come to an end? A pre-grieving, of sorts. Perhaps I am
pre-grieving to protect myself from the possibility of failing.

Still, I refuse to stop. These feet will set chase.

I remember a dream. I wind up at a small school in autumn. There is a
flowing quality to the leaves, a blend of color like chalk on pavement,
cloudy and unclear but there. It's my first day and you are there. I can
tell it's you because I have seen your picture. Here, it is as if I know
you. You are sitting with a group of friends, but we speak, too. I don't
remember what you said to me. I am in a rush, not yet late for my first
day but worried, for I haven't memorized the layout of campus. We speak
and then you pull me in, holding me close, and I sink into your body
like I have known you, like you have known me, and something stirs, but
the reality is clear enough that I pull away toward whatever building
lies in front of me and I call after you that I have to go, we can talk
later, not saying what I want, to just let you hold me again, that if I
had control over this I would stay, but my legs are not my own, and so
they take me to the building, for this is the one truth of this moment,
that I am concerned about being late because of course I am concerned
about being late. I don't remember what happened to those friends. Maybe
you sit back down with them in the warm grass, the open quad, or maybe
they disappear and were never really there. All I know with certainty is
that I woke up and you were gone, back to a picture, and I didn't know
you. I can remember this.

You don't like to think about time. You think about time like you tread
water. One glimpse below, the cloudy image of your legs and arms
circling through the water to stay afloat; but one glimpse won't do
much. Spend enough time thinking about time, the way moments intersect
and flow without end, and you begin to feel your limbs grow heavy, you
begin to think of the depth of the water, you begin to wonder about the
unknowns below, you begin to draw in breath more rapidly. You sink in
the endless abyss of time yet recall the fragility of time's quick
erasure.

Goodbyes echo. The goodbye of my sister on her wedding night, waving
from the car. The goodbye of my grandfather, my cheek pressed against
his. The goodbye of my roommates from college, our apartment bare, as if
it never held our existence, after which I wept in my mother's arms like
an inconsolable child. These goodbyes echo; I hear their sound waves
reverberated back to me. They do not exist in one moment, but many.
Because now, even now, I mourn these goodbyes, whispering quietly to
myself to make them real.

I wonder if writing about you will purge you from my skin. I cannot be
sure who *you* is. I don't know which you is you. I don't know which you
is me. Others exist here, too. Water through fingers---the image that
arises now, slippery, untraceable, and unclasped. I refuse to make a
fist.

I'm unsure of where this starts and where it ends. It exists without
boundaries, or at least, I suppose that's how grief feels. I wonder if
this is the end of writing of this, or if it's only the beginning.
*Write about something else*.
