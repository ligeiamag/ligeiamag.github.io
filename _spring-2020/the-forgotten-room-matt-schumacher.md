<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In the basement of the old house </p>
<p class="poemline">where we’d lived for many years,</p>
<p class="poemline">I found a secret door </p>
<p class="poemline">to a room I’d never seen before.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Several life-sized dolls were “living” there</p>
<p class="poemline">seated at a candlelit table </p>
<p class="poemline">for who knows how long,</p>
<p class="poemline">like a silent family, entombed.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">They stared above bare plates and silverware.</p>
<p class="poemline">The light flickered on their faces.</p>
<p class="poemline">As if they’d long expected me, </p>
<p class="poemline">they stared at me, but never moved.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">This was my welcome to the forgotten room.</p>
</div>
