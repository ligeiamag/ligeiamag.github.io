<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My courage wasn’t equal to the task</p>
<p class="poemline">of plugging in, performing for a crowd</p>
<p class="poemline">so ‒ pint by pint ‒ I’d paint a public mask</p>
<p class="poemline">until my blood like bitter honey flowed</p>
<p class="poemline">from vein to vein. The mic glowed on its stand;</p>
<p class="poemline">behind it Marshall stacks from last night’s band,</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">cymbals, organ and acoustic guitars ‒ </p>
<p class="poemline">each instrument transcendent in its poise.</p>
<p class="poemline">My name was on a list of would-be stars:</p>
<p class="poemline">newbies, greenhorns, most of us still just boys</p>
<p class="poemline">come into town with dreams of the big time</p>
<p class="poemline">to try our hand at harmless pantomime.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Just then, as I could hardly stand, I’d hear</p>
<p class="poemline">my name, its syllables a foreign tongue,</p>
<p class="poemline">eyes rooting me out everywhere. “I’m here,”</p>
<p class="poemline">I’d stammer (as I fashionably swung</p>
<p class="poemline">my guitar case across my back) and strut</p>
<p class="poemline">across the bar: eyes angry, flashing, hot</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">as coals or lava smoking in its bed.</p>
<p class="poemline">A thrift-store jacket and black turtleneck,</p>
<p class="poemline">Frye boots, on my uninsulated head</p>
<p class="poemline">brown silky hair that floated on the wreck</p>
<p class="poemline">of an impaired visage. Hand over hand</p>
<p class="poemline">I’d titillate the cobra from its sand</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">connect electric cables to the amps</p>
<p class="poemline">until the feedback rattled in its cage.</p>
<p class="poemline">It set your teeth on edge. Halogen lamps</p>
<p class="poemline">irradiated the postage-stamp-sized stage.</p>
<p class="poemline">I’d launch into my spotty repertoire:</p>
<p class="poemline">ten-minute Dylan songs, and clear the bar.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The boos and catcalls only fed my fear.</p>
<p class="poemline">I flopped and fled ‒ the faithful snow outside</p>
<p class="poemline">on Ludlow St., immaculate and clear,</p>
<p class="poemline">still falling, flaking. I picked up my stride</p>
<p class="poemline">a groaning pit of hunger in my gut ‒  </p>
<p class="poemline">acidic, urgent. In Katz’s I’d glut</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">two sour pickles, half a corned beef-on-rye</p>
<p class="poemline">slathered with mustard tart as young lemon,</p>
<p class="poemline">a steaming bowl of soup and apple pie</p>
<p class="poemline">then sit in the sulphureous light alone</p>
<p class="poemline">with a full belly and an empty mind</p>
<p class="poemline">my chicken heart inconstant as the wind.</p>
</div>
