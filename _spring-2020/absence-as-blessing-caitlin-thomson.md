<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I am holding a phone to my mouth like a microphone,</p>
<p class="poemline">as I walk through the ravine. Any stranger can see me.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In my throat there is absence. My child</p>
<p class="poemline">fills every space with words.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When she cannot think of the right ones</p>
<p class="poemline">she makes up new words.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">She is trying to turn the thoughts in her head</p>
<p class="poemline">into sense and language is not meeting her halfway.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">These days language rarely meets me anywhere.</p>
<p class="poemline">I start to argue, only to find myself at peace</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">with the argument. Where once there was anger,</p>
<p class="poemline">there is absence.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">There are larger problems to be found in this world</p>
<p class="poemline">than anger being replaced with emptiness.</p>
</div>
