## The Language of Moles

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Trees rust in the deep autumn</p>
<p class="poemline">like skeletal Chevrolets abandoned in the woods</p>
<p class="poemline">not far from where we are now. Listen —</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">you can hear acorns falling</p>
<p class="poemline">from the sky like dead satellites, hitting</p>
<p class="poemline">the grass with the soft finality</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of a last breath. And the crows</p>
<p class="poemline">are ecstatic — they swarm the sunset</p>
<p class="poemline">in vacuous clouds, black</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">as the rippling shadows</p>
<p class="poemline">battleships throw to the eastern waves,</p>
<p class="poemline">dappling the fins of lingering sharks.</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Decay is nothing new. We’ll all taste</p>
<p class="poemline">graveyard dirt and suck rainwater</p>
<p class="poemline">from dark yew roots. We’ll burrow</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">like cicadas into the sweet soil</p>
<p class="poemline">and forget about burning skyscrapers</p>
<p class="poemline">and the price of oil. We’ll know the soft</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">language of moles, the underworld’s</p>
<p class="poemline">earthy vault, and, at last,</p>
<p class="poemline">nothing else.</p>
</div>

## My Wife and the Ghost


<div class="poetryfont">

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And there was this.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A ghost that slivered itself from between worlds, leapt out of the snowy wolfwind on a</p>
<p class="poemline">December midnight. Slipped between blocked basement walls like sight through a keyhole. It</p>
<p class="poemline">woke the sleeping boy, the terrified boy who couldn’t move, against whose face the ghost</p>
<p class="poemline">molded like wet clay over a form, into whose ears the ghost whispered unknown threats before</p>
<p class="poemline">disappearing like snow melting upwards, backwards, into the hovering darkness.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And then again, on a rainy night. When I was older, and frozen in bed like a fish in an iced-</p>
<p class="poemline">through pond, when blackdrip shadows flowed from a hole in the world, there, over by my</p>
<p class="poemline">bookshelf, a coalescing darkthing that bull-rushed into me like a stormcloud slamming into a</p>
<p class="poemline">mountain, sank into me like a sacrificed prince settling into a peat bog’s soft death. The redblack</p>
<p class="poemline">molasses that flowed over my wide eyes, the world’s deep and terrible silence—not the rain’s</p>
<p class="poemline">teeth against the window, not the ceiling fan’s cyclic whir, not the old house creaking and</p>
<p class="poemline">popping in the night. Only blood rivering through my heart.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And then there was this.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My wife woke me, long later. Moon like a tooth through the curtains, her still-sleeping eyes like</p>
<p class="poemline">shuttered windows, her arm like an arrow pointing to a corner darkness by the closet, an</p>
<p class="poemline">impenetrable cavedarkness into which she told me to stare and see the thing watching us. Ice in</p>
<p class="poemline">my mouth, salt on my tongue, my jaw shot through with steel pins, her pointing hand suddenly a</p>
<p class="poemline">fist, a strong claw choking the silent air, the squirming shadows. The pure darkness that suddenly</p>
<p class="poemline">seemed less dark.</p>
</div>
