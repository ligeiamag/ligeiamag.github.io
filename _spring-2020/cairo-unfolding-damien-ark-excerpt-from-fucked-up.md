Dreaming of myself as a child again is always bizarre to me, you know,
that idea that I can only relive such distant memories when I'm lost in
my unconscious bath of chaotic space where time is nonexistent.
Underwater in my universe of sleep, I can see the uninhabitable coal
planets churning six hundred light-years away from the sun, wind so hot
and vicious that it would disintegrate bodies in milliseconds, sending
ashes halfway across its hundreds of monolithic active volcanoes that
spew hellfire up hundreds of miles high, and the fallen angels chained
to the unstable core, vacuums of dead space and black holes endlessly
sucking away everything that once was from the very beginning until
there's eventually nothing, until our universe is smaller than a penny,
than atom, than the dynamite explosion all over again where it's all
more or less the same as it was before. Does God die in all of that? Is
he reborn through this process of infinite death and rebirth? Here I am,
six-year-old Elliott seeing everything through the eyes of God, the same
God that would have me stoned to death, who flooded the planet I was
born on, who allowed millions of his own people to die, and so on and so
on ... God reveals to me a small sphere that symbolizes the pain and
suffering that I am in debt to, and then there is the entire planets
suffering, two spheres so tiny and ant-like compared to the sun behind
him, two spheres that he effortlessly tosses into the fireball, but I
tell him that I get the point, hey man you don't have to be so blunt
and scornful about it, already knew that you were a sham by this age
anyway.

Swimming upwards from out of Gods overflowing toilet, I eventually reach
the surface, emerge from out of the prophetic eclipse, and open my eyes
to be face to face with a lush pinkish-purple Cairo sunset. The sky is
so opaque and crystalline that I can't help but to stare at it until
one of the kid's swimming beside me tugs me back underwater, filling my
lungs up with Nile water, pulling myself back up with shock and
laughter. Scientists say that swimming here can leave you acceptable to
parasites that eat at your brain and lay worms in your liver and
intestines. They were most likely right because there are times that I
can feel and hear the babies squirming inside of my tubes, my veins, and
sometimes even through the pupil of my eyes.

Older boys that used to hang out around the bazaar would sometimes
invite me to go swimming here with them. Their secret location was
marked by a crashed school bus halfway stuck underwater. It was curved
and positioned in a way that made it possible to swim inside of the bus
and hide on the highest level of it above the river water. Sometimes
we'd go inside just to smoke cigarettes and talk gossip about women
that I didn't know. The trick was that you'd have to put your pack of
cigarettes into a sealed plastic bag inside of your swimming trunks to
keep them from getting soaked. I remember how it felt to hear my brain
cells ripping and popping when I'd smoke tobacco with them, and there
were several times I'd have to hide my puke in the sand while holding
back tears from a migraine.

Some of the children are crowded on top of the tilted bus and
sunbathing. Others pull trash out of the river and burn it in piles.
People climb inside of the bus, smash open windows and do front-flips
out of it to impress others. I, however, walk out towards the shore and
rest my back against a boulder so that I can better capture the sunset.
It's starting to bend and melt, which seems vaguely apocalyptic.

It's her again, the girl from the previous dream, and she's wearing
the same hijab, the floral and effervescent one that glimmers and
slightly blinds me, or maybe that's just my eyesight, or maybe it's
the parasitic worms. I'm supposed to follow her. We're sixty miles
from home. How did she find me here? Young girls like her aren't
supposed to know about the hideout. She must have been following me.
Goddess of the militant spiders.

She rummages through my bookbag, delicately feeling at the pages of the
novels inside, and then she mentions to me in Arabic, "Some of these
books are almost out of date. We should leave soon before the library
closes."

"Idiot girl," I bite back. "Helwan to Alexandria is two hundred and
fifty kilometers away."

But she says that distance isn't a problem, because she has a hot air
balloon a few miles away on top of an apartment complex. On the way
there, we walk into a train of camels wearing glow in the dark safety
vests. We feed them mixed oats and dates. By the entrance of the
apartment, there's this fountain made of adamite that is filled with
blood and for some reason, it doesn't concern me. But this is how the
dream world works. Nothing ever makes sense until you speak to a Spanish
ghost sealed into a haunted painting. Not even the starving woman
sleeping on a harp with a blindfold over her eyes next to the fountain
is enough to alert me into lucidity.

Once we reach the top of the roof, we do an improvised dance together as
children holding onto balconies from the apartment across the street
wave and laugh at us. Her balloon is a massive deflated orange bubble
hanging down and shadowing the top floor windows. Everything comes
together quite quickly in such an effortless way, more so it seems as if
she practically has lived in this thing for a longer part of her young
life. First, she revs up an electric fan that inflates the envelope, and
then she starts up the fire that breathes out and into the balloon. The
basket then begins to float off of the ground, which is when she shouts
at me to jump inside, which I do in the manner that only an idiot can
do, such as to fall into it and bruise my head against the woven wicker
that the basket is constructed of. She ends up stepping on the back of
my neck as soon as she hurdles her way into the basket, quickly standing
up to adjust the burner so that I can get a better and grimier taste of
her sandals that are matted with sand and dirt. We're already up a few
miles high by the time that I'm able to get back on my feet and catch
my breath.

"But what about the air," I ask her.

That's when she says, "You don't need to breathe. We're already dead.
Understand?"

I nod. Those might have been the only words I've heard in the dream
that I can adequately make out and understand.

We're leaving to have a picnic on Saturn, but before we get there, we
have to hitch a ride on top of the ISS and get a clear view of some
typhoons. That doesn't take as long as expected. Neither does speeding
our way through the solar system to land on the Enceladus moon. After we
land, I have a moment of head-scratching and chin-rubbing, in which I
remind her, "We still have to visit the library before it closes, you
know."

She knows, and to her amazement, the hieroglyphic rug and the fresh
salads she left behind are still there on the surface of this
never-ending ice terrain. According to her, two hours in the real world
is equal to six in the dream world, which means that we still have a
good twelve hours to go. "Besides," she shrugs. "We still have to visit
the south pole of Saturn."

And that's when I snarl, "Still an idiot! Enceladus to Saturn is one
hundred and forty-seven thousand and, um, eight hundred and ninety
miles! Where did you place my book bag, anyway? Oh no. Mother will kill
me! She will literally kill me! You don't understand!"

It's that banal touch from her fingertips to my fingertips that
silences the anxiety. She's drilled a hole through the crust of the
moon and we're about to dive into it so that we can place our hands
against its core, but then I wake up

Vomiting. Into the hands that I was about to touch the core of Enceladus
with.

A visual memory of Cairo consumes me. In this distant recollection, I
find myself outside of the Temple of Edfu with my mother and a few other
classmates while a musician channels the deity of Horus through his
voice and his hand-crafted oud. It's exactly six o' clock, thirty-four
minutes before the sunset, and the big star is flaring with a glorious
torrid warmth. We're leaning upwards on top of Persian rugs made of
silk and wool, dressed in beads of sweat, and digging our hands into the
scorching hot sand. Foreign visitors surround us but give an appropriate
distance away from our party. Mother is sitting cross-legged and I'm
resting my head in her lap. She runs her hands through my thick hair and
photographs the musician. Every now and then I would study the
hieroglyphic limestone carvings on the monolithic pylon in front of us,
but I mostly find myself staring at the musicians moist and bearded
face. The left palm of my hand is painted black while the other is
painted with velvet red spots. At one point during an intermission
between two songs, my mother holds my hands up towards the approaching
horizon. Elderly foreigners exit from out of the courtyard, some leaving
on buses, and others leave on rented camels. The music is more intimate
and metaphysical now. A schoolgirl sitting next to me wearing a
phlox-colored hijab extends her arms, forming a star with her body on
top of her crumpled rug, and stares at me until I notice her. Earlier
that day, she had painted my hands and legs and I had lightly painted
her face with seaweed green face-paint. Something about her face in that
moment haunted me, even more so when she began to cry. It wasn't a
heavy sob. Just faint. Almost as if she was ashamed. Mother rested her
hand inside of my hair while I had taken hands with the girl next to me.
All that I can remember after that is the sound of the Nubian oud
playing as I had shut my eyes to connect in an empathetic meditation
with my friend from school. The sound of sand blowing into my ears, over
my face, inside of my nostrils, mother brushing the dust from off my
eyelids, mother and I together in peace, in the temple of a sky God,
feeling at his wings, seeing through his eyes, the moon and the sun,
standing inside of his temple, and finding God through him.
