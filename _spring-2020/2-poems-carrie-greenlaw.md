## *Chilopoda*

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Little flies like bronze seeds</p>
<p class="poemline">exhaust entire clumsy lives</p>
<p class="poemline">in kitchens, never knowing</p>
<p class="poemline">pale water, dog shit.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Each morning I hang</p>
<p class="poemline">from the ceiling, cocooned.</p>
<p class="poemline">I am a species known</p>
<p class="poemline">for staying where found</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">unless persuaded</p>
<p class="poemline">by upended broom.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I circle the baseboards,</p>
<p class="poemline">seek skin cells and swell</p>
<p class="poemline">to the inhuman length of mothers –</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">my mild attitude</p>
<p class="poemline">my rippling architecture.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Most noonday homes look empty.</p>
<p class="poemline">I vanish into foundation cracks,</p>
<p class="poemline">a formless chain of consciousness,</p>
<p class="poemline">a thousand fists to clench.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I gather the washer and dryer,</p>
<p class="poemline">snow shovels and lamps</p>
<p class="poemline">in my coils like a clutch</p>
<p class="poemline">of lustrous eggs.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I am fecund and venomous.</p>
<p class="poemline">My children glow with immunity.</p>

</div>

## Phosphorus Makes Glow but Eats Bones like a Hag

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We’ve spent too long in my hut.</p>
<p class="poemline">Winter pulls up to peer in the windows but</p>
<p class="poemline">I am Baba Yaga, rag-mad,</p>
<p class="poemline">clutching bowls of salt.</p>
<p class="poemline">I knit myself a new maidenhead with</p>
<p class="poemline">all this curdled milk. The house</p>
<p class="poemline">stinks of it, this house without men.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Here knobby cats drool flea dirt dreams</p>
<p class="poemline">while the baby wails around</p>
<p class="poemline">a bitten thumb and wets her pants again.</p>
<p class="poemline">She howls and I snarl back, feral throats</p>
<p class="poemline">falling open like the unwashed mouths of curs.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We always end in tears.</p>
<p class="poemline">Her thin leak of snot is asinine</p>
<p class="poemline">but paints the door of future comfort.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In slanted afternoon I swig</p>
<p class="poemline">vinegar and eat handfuls of boys.</p>
<p class="poemline">Mule-faced, she leaves a golden inch</p>
<p class="poemline">in the bowl behind my chair.</p>
<p class="poemline">The dim ceiling perfumes with girl piss,</p>
<p class="poemline">cat piss and my fevering skin.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The dead can't haunt me. </p>
<p class="poemline">My brain is already bristling with </p>
<p class="poemline">the thousand eyeless needles of porcupine fur. </p>
<p class="poemline">I curl around the baby until the last black dagger </p>
<p class="poemline">scratches my forehead and </p>
<p class="poemline">we wait for the thaw.  </p>

</div>
