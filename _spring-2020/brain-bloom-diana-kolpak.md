<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the world explodes inside her head</p>
<p class="poemline">shedding stars</p>
<p class="reidel-open">So beautiful...</p>
<p class="poemline">fragments of memory</p>
<p class="poemline">travel at light-speed</p>
<p class="poemline">folding into grey matter</p>
<p class="poemline">she crumples in a graceful heap</p>
<p class="poemline">lands with her face toward the sky</p>
<p class="poemline">registers fast-tracking clouds</p>
<p class="poemline">then moves inside</p>
<p class="poemline">into her own light</p>
<p class="poemline">blood mixes with neurons</p>
<p class="poemline">image with matter</p>
<p class="poemline">breaching the boundary between</p>
<p class="poemline">known and unknown</p>
<p class="poemline">zigzag flashes of purple</p>
<p class="poemline">blossom in unreadable code</p>
<p class="reidel-open">I smell roses. Does it have to be roses?</p>
<p class="poemline">a river of whispers surrounds her</p>
<p class="poemline">she feels herself sinking</p>
<p class="poemline">beneath</p>
<p class="poemline">soft hands stroke her arms and face</p>
<p class="poemline">she twists away</p>
<p class="poemline">and spirals into forever</p>
<p class="poemline">in a long slow glide</p>
<p class="reidel-open">Goodbye.</p>
<p class="reidel-open">Hello.</p>
<p class="reidel-open">Is anybody out there?</p>
<p class="poemline">lights</p>
<p class="poemline">out</p>
