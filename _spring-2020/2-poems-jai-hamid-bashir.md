## Brief Conversations with a Little Moon

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even this planet bears secrets, Little Moon.</p>
<p class="poemline">Little Moon, you are an unfaithful lover roped in</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without siphoning the morning sky for clues.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A lover’s hair that accidently spells out love in cursive</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pulled into orbit with our vision concomitant</p>
<p class="poemline">on both your glittering leaving and faint arrival.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">There is no such thing as time in space,</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just private choreographies. We are often late</p>
<p class="poemline">to the dance: two years of you, Little Moon, and no light</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of knowledge, just shoaling in unseen circuit</p>
<p class="poemline">above us without discovery. Gravity, a quiet thief, pockets</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small, cold unforever coins of the Universe.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Claims bodies with a bright sickle</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of wonder. Reaping in glitterfreeze,</p>
<p class="poemline">sintering a handful of orbits, and then release.</p>
</div>


<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will you tell the rest, Little Moon?</p>
<p class="poemline">About what you witnessed of Earth?</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will you return? Could we be just be</p>
</div>


<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">another dim stone on the cairn of your travels?</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Moon, scuttled between planets</p>
<p class="poemline">you are a silvered fish, invisible to the naked eye that opens</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her mouth in warm zeroes. Then you will go</p>
<p class="poemline">back into the dark ravine of an eternity</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that goes on without our favors or wishes.</p>
</div>

## The Dionysian Mysteries

<p class="font-italic" style="margin-left:7rem;">For my friend, Patrick J. Bayly</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Where the water curves in gentle slither. There is no such thing as a logical roar, it all</p>
<p class="poemline">arrives from fear. The anxious Oracle waits on the shale border of a swimming pool, a</p>
<p class="poemline">knife shivers at the bottom. I am that Oracle. My heart becomes unpearled.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">It is nothing, just shaving cream. The Painter is painting a subtler moon. The one tonight</p>
<p class="poemline">is too white and we have enough plates. The wealthy people don’t clap their hands,</p>
<p class="poemline">they ring their wedding jewelry. I’ve sat on top of ladders I cannot climb.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">From those heights I have announced I am not of color, I am just colorful.</p>
<p class="poemline">I was then naked in between a trinity of my old lovers and whispered Lorca,</p>
<p class="poemline">like an angel-for-hire in the canals of their ears. Anti-odes:</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">a juddering fruit bat is an anti-angel, and is such a useful pollinator. I spread the words</p>
<p class="poemline">of The Oracle in verbal graffiti and we are muted in mystery. This knife is not a gun, and</p>
<p class="poemline">it does not need to be shot to be in this poem. We take off our swimsuits.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Our hearts darken swimming in laps</p>
<p class="poemline">in shapes of numbers we never knew dialed into rotary phones.</p>
<p class="poemline">We talked about riches and the soil in The Hamptons</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">tastes like honey made from miraculous wasps. Out of water,</p>
<p class="poemline">I call The Painter’s name, a sorghum blessing, and he sang an Appalachian tune with a</p>
<p class="poemline">side of milkshake and oranged barbecue-chip hands. Together, we unstrung each</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">violence of a supernova from its tether. I knew what was coming, but I let it remain</p>
<p class="poemline">unnoticed like a pool of glittering blood</p>
<p class="poemline">by a silent cage of sleeping chickens.</p>
</div>
