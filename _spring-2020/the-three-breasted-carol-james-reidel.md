<div class="stanza">

<p class="reidel-open">Then Joseph flew in anger, in anger flew he,</p>
<p class="reidel-open">Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!</p>

<br />

<p class="poemline">Nor did the Son of God cease in his humiliations of the old</p>
<p class="poemline">man, the Nobody of Galilei, not when Mary pled, “Joseph,</p>
<p class="poemline">Joseph please, buy me bread! My breasts have run all dry.”</p>
<p class="poemline">But Joseph had waited for this moment. He had hidden a</p>
<p class="poemline">roll within the folds of his cloak for many days and would</p>
<p class="poemline">not be caught in naked resentment ever again or be reminded</p>
<p class="poemline">of his impotence, of having to look but do not touch, even</p>
<p class="poemline">though he could feast his eyes upon her flesh every time she</p>
<p class="poemline">bared it to nurse the <em>thing</em>. So, he showed them the roll and</p>
<p class="poemline">the bite mark, which he delivered like a blow, the piece he</p>
<p class="poemline">spat on the way back to the stable, for it was already as green</p>
<p class="poemline">as the serpent who planted the delicious thought. “The boy,”</p>
<p class="poemline">said Joseph, “should learn to share.” And with that the suck-</p>
<p class="poemline">ling’s lips broke red as any blood from the exertion. It did</p>
<p class="poemline">not wail but regarded the bite with a sidelong look, as Jo-</p>
<p class="poemline">seph’s black nails all met the way flies crowd on carrion. It</p>
<p class="poemline">wailed not as Joseph crushed the bun into a pill of bread.</p>
<p class="poemline">“That is my miracle,” said Joseph. “Is there any less to share?”</p>
<p class="poemline">But the pretty baby only looked away with the same sidelong</p>
<p class="poemline">look. With his little finger, with the smallest, the pearliest of</p>
<p class="poemline">his nails, which could still smart one’s eyes, with just enough</p>
<p class="poemline">hesitation for Joseph to get a good look in, he touched the</p>
<p class="poemline">bare spot, where his mother’s heart beat loud above even the</p>
<p class="poemline">animals lowing in foreboding. There appeared a third breast,</p>
<p class="poemline">one full between two dugs. “No!” Mary cried—“Freak!” Jo-</p>
<p class="poemline">seph—and “Lo!” the Angel of God. He consoled her then</p>
<p class="poemline">and there. He made a like excuse, “this is how the Son of</p>
<p class="poemline">Man shares, not by making less to see, but by making more.”</p>
<br />
