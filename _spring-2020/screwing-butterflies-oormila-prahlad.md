<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">It’s one of those chance finds &mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">a glorious Common Crow</p>
<p class="poemline">lying on the footpath</p>
<p class="poemline">missing an abdomen</p>
<p class="poemline">just thorax and wings</p>
<p class="poemline">still intact</p>
<p class="poemline">though turned and twisted</p>
<p class="poemline">into an unnatural pose</p>
<p class="poemline">markings unsullied</p>
<p class="poemline">cream spots curdled on black.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">squatting on the sidewalk</p>
<p class="poemline">I take my time </p>
<p class="poemline">scooping it into a tissue</p>
<p class="poemline">ignoring passers-by </p>
<p class="poemline">who stare at my hand</p>
<p class="poemline">in undisguised disgust.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">in the studio</p>
<p class="poemline">I untwist the wings</p>
<p class="poemline">sponging the green trail </p>
<p class="poemline">of gelatinous ooze</p>
<p class="poemline">dabbing a spot of superglue</p>
<p class="poemline">on a black screw &mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">a make-shift abdomen.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and attaching the top half</p>
<p class="poemline">I spread out its wings</p>
<p class="poemline">mount the Common Crow</p>
<p class="poemline">and get ready to have a go</p>
<p class="poemline">when Val came by unannounced.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">she can’t decide the term for me</p>
<p class="poemline">depraved necrophiliac, she says</p>
<p class="poemline">tapping her walking stick </p>
<p class="poemline">and screwing up her nose</p>
<p class="poemline">but I assure her</p>
<p class="poemline">that that’s not what this is &mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">that I brought it home </p>
<p class="poemline">for a model</p>
<p class="poemline">not a lay.</p>
</div>
