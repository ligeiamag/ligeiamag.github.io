<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Someone’s granddaughter, trussed</p>
<p class="poemline">for devour, famine seized,</p>
<p class="poemline">like senna leaf wrestles the weary</p>
<p class="poemline">from lethargy’s yawn, and respired</p>
<p class="poemline">hunger as an art to chisel</p>
<p class="poemline">through her body. Sinew and nerve</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">store memory—like the bruised</p>
<p class="poemline">mattress her mother’s mother stuffs</p>
<p class="poemline">with portraits of dead men</p>
<p class="poemline">to summon if: roots let go, runoff</p>
<p class="poemline">spits on the porcelain,</p>
<p class="poemline">or the girl needs repair—</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">so granny’s little Thunder Thighs</p>
<p class="poemline">drives the cross</p>
<p class="poemline">cut from fat to ivory</p>
<p class="poemline">stone, burns meat off marrow,</p>
<p class="poemline">blunts every muscle’s memory</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of late nights limbs played dead,</p>
<p class="poemline">and her spirit fled to nana’s</p>
<p class="poemline">kitchen—where Holy smoke unspools</p>
<p class="poemline">hair—to curl inside her</p>
<p class="poemline">a cappella lore</p>
<p class="poemline">and self-possessed laugh,</p>
<p class="poemline">after she’d sucked the last</p>
<p class="poemline">meat off a skinned calf’s bone.</p>
</div>
