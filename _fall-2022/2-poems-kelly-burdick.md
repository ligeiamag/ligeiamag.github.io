## Flamegold and Honey Locust
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">O, god of Augusts,</p>
<p class="poemline">you take. You take</p>
<p class="poemline">until I am left with tinder grass</p>
<p class="poemline">and cracked riverbeds. You steal</p>
<p class="poemline">the sweetness from fire. I lie</p>
<p class="poemline">on my back in the dust</p>
<p class="poemline">with my face to palest blue and curse</p>
<p class="poemline">my own mouth, your chapped hands. I look</p>
<p class="poemline">at you the way two locusts stare</p>
<p class="poemline">at each other with flat hunger and know</p>
<p class="poemline">the emptiness tearing at the other’s throat.</p>

## Abecedarian
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Autumn slipped his hand around my throat</p>
<p class="poemline">but it was already severed and spilling</p>
<p class="poemline">cut up words across his IKEA carpet.</p>
<p class="poemline">Don’t think I wasn’t embarrassed, okay?</p>
<p class="poemline">Even then, his fingertips throbbed as he</p>
<p class="poemline">felt the Adam’s apple in my neck, a</p>
<p class="poemline">gentle, bodily distance between</p>
<p class="poemline">head and shoulders. It’s a mess.</p>
<p class="poemline">I can’t speak, or else I’d tell him to either</p>
<p class="poemline">just snap my spine back together like</p>
<p class="poemline">Kinnex or Legos or whatever, or</p>
<p class="poemline">let me go. Drop my head out a window,</p>
<p class="poemline">make do with the body on the floor like</p>
<p class="poemline">Nike of Samothrace with her wings</p>
<p class="poemline">out and her head gone. Why not</p>
<p class="poemline">peel off my arms too? Make me a</p>
<p class="poemline">quaint statue of victory, Autumn.</p>
<p class="poemline">Remember your conquest? Now I’m</p>
<p class="poemline">silent for the first time and it feels like</p>
<p class="poemline">testimony. Tell me everything</p>
<p class="poemline">you thought was true about God, your</p>
<p class="poemline">Victory’s all ears, even from the pavement,</p>
<p class="poemline">waiting with the patience of stones to hear any</p>
<p class="poemline">excuse for this mess of a rug. But instead,</p>
<p class="poemline">you say “whatever. Just pop your</p>
<p class="poemline">Zaleplon and forget about it.”</p>
</div>
