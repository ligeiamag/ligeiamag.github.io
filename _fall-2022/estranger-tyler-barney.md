<div class="stanza">

<p class="poemline">how these things happen</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">always fearing i’ll see her</p>
<p class="poemline">everywhere i don’t go</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">in blinks between glances</p>
<p class="poemline">i’ve been seeing someone</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">at the movies: her head</p>
<p class="poemline">floating up on the screen</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">on the beach: her body</p>
<p class="poemline">washing up on the shore</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">in my arms: her absence</p>
<p class="poemline">making its presence known</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">if i had a choice i wouldn’t</p>
<p class="poemline">go to her funeral again</p>
</div>
