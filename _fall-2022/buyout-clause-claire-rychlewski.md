<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Think of a man—</p>
<p class="poemline">any man you know</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Will he crush your bones</p>
<p class="poemline">beneath the balls of his feet?</p>
<p class="poemline">Is it worse if he refuses?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Who will lick my spray tan</p>
<p class="poemline">off my toes like you?</p>
<p class="poemline">Who else needs to get that close?</p>
