<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;God said, How circular the argument the saints purvey. The rows of crows</p>
<p class="poemline">and concentrated umbrages of moons askew, serenity is for the very few. My</p>
<p class="poemline">secret safe with stable equilibria, each contour line a precipice and my decline but</p>
<p class="poemline">piecewise constant, to my gyroscope zing went the strings. God said, Consider</p>
<p class="poemline">whirling dervishes, their axes of rotation in alignment. The amended axiom of</p>
<p class="poemline">choice prescribes two of each kind.</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;God said, To deny me my conclusion is to be irrational. God said, on Noah’s</p>
<p class="poemline">arc an edge, the adage gets it backwards. Optic nerves need not apply. It’s</p>
<p class="poemline">birdcage if not birthday cake. I need no pendulum. I’ll be a patent troll. God said,</p>
<p class="poemline">I wash my hands of Pontius Pilate and my feet of Jesus and from crow’s nests</p>
<p class="poemline">opposites to lobby me an object of Aristotelian logic. The eyes of attorneys</p>
<p class="poemline">general are the windows of attorneys general’s souls.</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;God said, Associate the number zero with the empty set. On hearing car</p>
<p class="poemline">alarms, God hardened Pharaoh’s heart. On losing contact with reality, I sent my</p>
<p class="poemline">complements to the place which was shaded only yesterday. I’d never curse an</p>
<p class="poemline">animal with ears, says Goldilocks, dismissing simultaneously ultraviolet and</p>
<p class="poemline">infrared. God said, associate the number zero with the empty set. I think that I’m</p>
<p class="poemline">Napoleon therefore I’m not. The volume of the solid is computed with a simple</p>
<p class="poemline">triple integral. The distribution that is Gaussian to you is Gaussian to me.</p>
<p class="poemline">Accelerometers do not fall far from trees. An octopus sans blind spot, I’ll hang</p>
<p class="poemline">my hopes on one red-nosed reindeer at a time.</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;God said, What next will mortals make of precedent and antecedent? Strike</p>
<p class="poemline">me lightning twice and shame on me, Beelzebub to be, and not to be my favorite</p>
<p class="poemline">source of darkness. There are three and one half adolescents in your average time</p>
<p class="poemline">machine. Remember me in any order, my addenda loudly to lament, the innocent</p>
<p class="poemline">to innocently flee. The gentle curve is that of a moraine. Some thumbs say to</p>
<p class="poemline">some fingers, Who’s opposing who? I’m walking back my happiness, at ease. I’m</p>
<p class="poemline">well advised to hold the chalice tentatively, to extrapolate from random passages.</p>
<p class="poemline">Change one of your parameters and you would be diminished. Of the two</p>
<p class="poemline">competing deities how will I know which is the good one?</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;God said, Consider these united states, consider these tectonic plates. As</p>
<p class="poemline">virtue is derivative but sin original, Go figure, I say, counting bounces. I see no</p>
<p class="poemline">gorilla. Although all of us are made by some creator, some are made by some</p>
<p class="poemline">creator more. Negotiating for the hostages I’ll have beginner’s luck. The ether as</p>
<p class="poemline">inclusive as the metaphor, from equilibrium to equilibrium a handout for the</p>
<p class="poemline">ne’er-do-well but nothing in the forest for the trees, as innocent as by dissociation</p>
<p class="poemline">these depictions have more nuance than their subjects, and obsessions, would that</p>
<p class="poemline">they could be compulsions. Damn the costume continuity, my doppelganger right</p>
<p class="poemline">or wrong.</p>
