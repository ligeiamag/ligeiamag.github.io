<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>There is but one truly serious philosophical problem</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>and that is suicide.</em></p>
<p class="poemline">- Some Asshole Philosopher.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">On or around my 40th birthday surrounded by no progeny,</p>
<p class="poemline">prepared for no future, faced with the specter of decline,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I believe in life again. I can’t stop…. I drink leftover wine,</p>
<p class="poemline">souring but salvageable, with a group of close friends.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The horizon, a strummed cord, lifts, swerves left.</p>
<p class="poemline">A frayed cord snapping. I’m thinking about…</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the clean-up, rigorous and thorough. A shovel and a hose,</p>
<p class="poemline">nooks and crannies. Not the specter of decline: death.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I find it hard to slow down but when I do I think <em>waste</em>.</p>
<p class="poemline">I say un-nice things to myself. My brain bubbles.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Thoughts cling like bubbles to bubbles, like humanity</p>
<p class="poemline">facing its end, like when I drink leftover wine with friends,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">quivering, bursting, splashing. Wipe down all surfaces.</p>
<p class="poemline">Absorbent materials may be unsalvageable. My father,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">hunched and slowing, poised at the lip of the cliff of decline,</p>
<p class="poemline">stares into the middle distance, says, <em>I’m waiting for</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>my meds to kick in</em>. What was once brilliant I pronounce</p>
<p class="poemline">brilliant always. He says he thinks about it all the time.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Brains sabotaging brains. When called upon to solve</p>
<p class="poemline">someone’s loneliness, I say what Sharon said. I say</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>say nice things to yourself when you’re alone with yourself.</em></p>
<p class="poemline">When called upon to solve someone’s loneliness</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I tell them a story of a sex move gone awry. Out back of</p>
<p class="poemline">Riverside Tavern a woman leaning against the dumpster,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">dress hiked up, her man behind her. She asks for a cigarette.</p>
<p class="poemline">I bum her a cigarette. A receipt stuck to the inside</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">(Seven-Eleven, pork rinds and a Slurpee, $4.23), water bugs</p>
<p class="poemline">scurrying over water bugs, rats feeding on rats I imagine.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A Slurpee spilt like brains, brilliant, brilliant brains,</p>
<p class="poemline">slurped and spit up, emulsified, brain swill, sluice,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">zombie snack. I can’t stop... Pink like birthday cake</p>
<p class="poemline">icing, pink as the pom-poms of the crepe myrtles</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">cheering us on, browning mid-shake. But not pink,</p>
<p class="poemline">not even brown: Gray. Gray matters.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">On or around my 40th birthday at Riverside Tavern</p>
<p class="poemline">two moos and a whinny from the end of the bar.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Someone is getting conceived tonight! Another</p>
<p class="poemline">slick human dropped in the plinko pit of life eventually</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">to find themselves with a gun in their hand. The gun to</p>
<p class="poemline">their head. Their head over a dumpster. The dumpster</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">behind their nursing home. The nursing home on</p>
<p class="poemline">Forest View Rd. several streets over from where,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">on or around my 40th birthday, I sit drinking</p>
<p class="poemline">leftover wine with friends. The horizon like a sex move</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">gone awry. A fatal wound and the gun keeps going off.</p>
</div>
