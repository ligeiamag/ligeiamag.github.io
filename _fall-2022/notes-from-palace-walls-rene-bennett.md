<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Last night I crashed Daddy’s Tesla and the evening sky exploded into moonlight and in the</p>
<p class="poemline">wreckage and in the radiance I saw rays of an archangelic clarity, the face of Gabriel, soft and</p>
<p class="poemline">sovereign, holding golden lilies, saying I must reevaluate my definition of success.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I’ve been seeing the Madonna every night in my dreams lately, or at least some belladonna of</p>
<p class="poemline">false hope. Her holy hands clench around my wicked throat and I suffer to be revived in her hold.</p>
<p class="poemline">Oh god I want to be revived I need a life supply of lullabies not these silvery threads popping</p>
<p class="poemline">pills nor the fear facing my sterilized sunset-colored impression of reality. It’s all pretend, my</p>
<p class="poemline">friends are paper cutouts, falling flat at the slightest breath.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I am reevaluating my definition of success.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I pull hymns from my head that haven’t been remixed yet, they venerate the rundown cabaret,</p>
<p class="poemline">shameless heartache, naked bodies thrown into space. Behind my puerile American dream it’s all</p>
<p class="poemline">parting and departing, construction destruction reconstruction redestruction flames on the</p>
<p class="poemline">mattress, on the walls.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Get me off this acropolis. In my alcoholic dreams of Her I unleash it: I am overloaded,</p>
<p class="poemline">undernourished, treading undercurrents of an unremembered lifetime. When we’re dancing</p>
<p class="poemline">mechanically on the rooftop I always ponder jumping off, setting my status to ground zero,</p>
<p class="poemline">where no one can watch me. We’re holding hands they’re all colorless and cold, going to no</p>
<p class="poemline">Heaven, overdosing in cities of gold. I float along these strobe-lit roads that go nowhere and I</p>
<p class="poemline">can’t stand it. I can’t stand the palace. I can’t stand the drive.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">But when we crashed I felt alive I was trembling all over heartbeats in my eyes and in the sky.</p>
<p class="poemline">Insobriety. The taste of blood. Angelic devastation. There is no vision of prosperity, which is so</p>
<p class="poemline">uneventful anyway, a term that manufactures success on cyber riches and swimming pools</p>
<p class="poemline">filtered by dissociation. No it was a vision of sincerity and the Angel was promising me things</p>
<p class="poemline">more beautiful than chandelier lights and as they pulled my limbs from the crushed and battered</p>
<p class="poemline">automobile he showered me with lilies and as I gazed skyward from the stretcher he kissed</p>
<p class="poemline">between my eyes, he set me alight, something shivered in the blue night and I saw clearly a</p>
<p class="poemline">shimmering absence, they call it paradise</p>
</div>
