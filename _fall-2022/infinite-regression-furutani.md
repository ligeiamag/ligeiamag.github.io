*It's a place to relax and put your feet up*, my husband said when we
toured the house next to his childhood home. *Mother will cook for you
and Auntie will clean for you*. He kneeled and leaned his face against
my core. He told me every day he plans to kiss my stomach and say,
*don't work too hard*.

*Don't work too hard*, I say before he leaves in the morning. I put my
feet on the coffee table and wait for the day to begin.

In the city, there was always something to do. Walking was something to
do. Staring at art was something to do. Drinking a sixteen dollar beer
was something to do. Memories from my former life resemble whirlpools of
flesh and concrete. In my mind, my former apartment is a ghost, I can no
longer remember the bedroom or the kitchen or whether there was floor or
carpet. When I try to recall my commute to work, I imagine myself
walking down empty boulevards and into black hole subway stations.

Now, I sit on the couch and stare out the window as Auntie sweeps under
my feet. I look up and see Mother standing above me, cradling a pot of
mashed potatoes.

*When I was pregnant all I ate were mashed potatoes*. She tosses an inch
of butter in the sludge.

I'm not pregnant, at least not yet, but I still nod.

*When I was pregnant all I did was nothing*, Auntie says. She places two
cucumbers on my eyelids.

*How do they know?* I think. *Are they tracking my period? Did they
plant a camera in the bedroom and, while checking my ovulation dates,
watch me fuck their precious son-slash-nephew raw?*

Before I realize what is happening, Mother places a spoonful of potato
in my mouth. Auntie presses the cucumber into my eyeballs. Back and
forth they take turns until my head tips forward and I snooze like a
child.

When Husband comes home, I'm on the bed like a beached whale. He unhooks
my bra and I undo his belt, then he grabs my head from behind and kisses
my lips. I quickly look around the room to search for any hidden
cameras. Husband follows my gaze, then covers my eyes.

They were right. There has been a living thing in my body for six weeks.
Mother, Auntie and Husband all knew before me, of course they did. This
morning, I woke up to three faces staring at me.

Husband puts his hand to my forehead.

Auntie pinches my ear.

Mother pulls out my tongue.

To celebrate, dinner was scalloped potatoes sandwiched between thick
slices of gouda, topped with mini pickles and a splash of dijon mustard.

</figure>

The tubers make me dream about birthing everything. In my dream, my
husband stares in shock. *I can't believe you fucked a whale*, he says,
as a baby orca fills up the maternity ward.

Mother places a television remote in my hand and Auntie picks up my
calf.

*When I was pregnant all I wanted to do was watch soap operas*. Mother
turns on Days of Our Lives*.*

*When I was pregnant all I wanted to do was get a massage*. Auntie
presses her knuckles into my soft leg. I wince and she presses harder.

*How did you know about the pregnancy?* I ask. I still don't feel
anything inside. No symptoms, just constipation.

Mother feeds me from a pot of mashed potatoes again. When I'm full I
turn my head away but Auntie pushes me forward and Mother presses the
spoon down my throat until all the potatoes are gone. No one answers my
question.

Husband does not think it is funny when I say we should name the baby
Spud.

*There's a potato in my stomach*, I think. Months later, I am still on
the couch and Auntie is still sweeping under my feet. There's a potato
growing eyes and ears. Whenever I think of a living creature inside my
living body, I heave.

*I'm sick of potatoes*, I say to Mother. *I don't want to look at
another one again in my life*.

*You need them to make your baby stronger.*

*If I eat another I'm going to give birth to one.*

*I promise you, that is impossible.*

Mother sends me to bed without dinner. For the first time, I feel the
fingerling move inside, surfing along the waves of hunger.

Potatoes have eyes. They are formed when the potato is neglected.

I am alone. After I refused to eat, Husband, Mother and Auntie went on
strike and refused to come over. I think about escaping. Lately my
memory's been getting worse and worse. I search everywhere but there is
no front door. Holding my lumpy middle, I walk in circles and slowly
realize I have never left the house. I look outside the window and the
view is obscured by fog. I lean closer and notice the window is painted
over. The cupboards are empty and the fridge holds one dehydrated tuber.

  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/dinkus.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="d-block mx-auto" alt="Blank Space" style="max-height:15px;" />
</figure>

I think about the thing inside me. I think about myself, trapped inside
a house. Layers of houses and wombs, spiraling and simultaneously
growing together.

I wake in the hospital to three faces staring at me.

Husband puts his hand to my forehead.

Auntie pinches my ear.

Mother pulls out my tongue.

The trio smile with all their teeth. My hands instinctively reach for my
middle.

*Where is it?* I ask. *Where is my little Spud?*

Before leaving the room, Mother and Auntie touch Husband's back.

My husband kneels on the floor so his face is level with mine. This much
I remember: I have lived no life without this face. When he locks eyes
with me, he turns back into Husband, the son-slash-nephew of Mother and
Auntie, the dutiful Husband who leaves me at seven in the morning and
returns at seven at night, who forgoes dinner to pleasure me in our
small bedroom.

I feel Mother and Auntie's eyes burning through the window. I touch my
stomach again, shocked at its concaveness.

*Mother*. He strokes my damp hair and places his face on my core.

*Mother!* Mother and Auntie enter the room, holding a celebratory
bouquet of orange yams.

A living thing, all wrapped up in blankets, is placed in my arms. I inch
the cloth away and see a lumpy mass, dotted with moles and growing
sporadic, wiry hairs.

I turn to Husband and my body acts appropriately, even though I feel
nothing. Water cascades down my face and my mouth is open and making
noises. Husband smiles. The thing coos.

I look up and see Grand Mother and Grand Auntie newly wrinkled, holding
canes that were not present seconds ago. Husband is gray and I am no
longer in the hospital bed, I am holding the sticklike hand of an
orange-tinted human as it grunts and heaves. Dirt spills on the floor
and again, I feel water on my face.
