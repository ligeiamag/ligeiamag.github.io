<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">You wake up and have no idea</p>
<p class="poemline">where you are. You’re in a room</p>
<p class="poemline">you’ve never been in before.</p>
<p class="poemline">You get up and open the door,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">walk out into another room</p>
<p class="poemline">somehow even less familiar</p>
<p class="poemline">than the one you just left. You go</p>
<p class="poemline">through the rest of your life like that—</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">room after room, day after day,</p>
<p class="poemline">meeting new person after new person—</p>
<p class="poemline">everything all new. You wake up</p>
<p class="poemline">and your nose is covered in hair.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">You check yourself over, head to toe,</p>
<p class="poemline">and that’s it, only your nose.</p>
<p class="poemline">You think about how maybe it would be better</p>
<p class="poemline">if it were all of you. All hair. You never wake up</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">as a cockroach. You wake up</p>
<p class="poemline">and you’re naked, standing in front</p>
<p class="poemline">of a classroom. You wake up</p>
<p class="poemline">and you’re the complete opposite</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of who you were before. What exactly</p>
<p class="poemline">that means is up to you. You never wake up</p>
<p class="poemline">at 6 a.m., the sound of your alarm playing</p>
<p class="poemline">“I Got You, Babe.” You wake up</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">to an incredible, uncanny, overwhelming,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">debilitating sense of déjà vu. You wake up</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and feel like you’re falling. Down</p>
<p class="poemline">an elevator shaft, out of an airplane,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">from a bridge, through a great empty expanse</p>
<p class="poemline">of nothing, down down down… You wake up</p>
<p class="poemline">with a glowing feeling of euphoria. It feels</p>
<p class="poemline">like you’re floating. You take your hand</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and try to slide it between your body</p>
<p class="poemline">and your mattress, and startle</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">when it does so freely. You are in fact</p>
<p class="poemline">floating. On purpose? Is this something</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">you can control? How long will it last?</p>
<p class="poemline">As soon as your brain forms the question,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">your body falls back to reality. You don’t wake up.</p>
<p class="poemline">That was it. Did you expect something else?</p>
</div>
