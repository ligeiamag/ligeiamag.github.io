<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The moon is broken in half, he told</p>
<p class="poemline">me and so are you but notice the</p>
<p class="poemline">softness, this no jagged loss. The</p>
<p class="poemline">moon is broken in half, he told me</p>
<p class="poemline">but even the crumbling seam</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">glows a halo of forgiveness, so you</p>
<p class="poemline">can too. I lost myself gazing into</p>
<p class="poemline">the surface yellow and the mellower</p>
<p class="poemline">edge that was more grace than</p>
<p class="poemline">fragility. And I told him he was</p>
<p class="poemline">wrong</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">about the moon and wrong about</p>
<p class="poemline">me. Neither of us were broken.</p>
<p class="poemline">There are just some places light</p>
<p class="poemline">forgets to shine until it remembers</p>
<p class="poemline">again, and light always remembers</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">especially about me and especially</p>
<p class="poemline">the moon. I am not broken without</p>
<p class="poemline">him and the moon isn’t broken</p>
<p class="poemline">without the sun, only revealing its</p>
<p class="poemline">shadow self. The moon is always</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">whole, whether it shines or not. I</p>
<p class="poemline">am whole even without him. Dark is</p>
<p class="poemline">a profound shining, and most of</p>
<p class="poemline">space is dark, and all of time is</p>
<p class="poemline">made of the pauses between actions.</p>
</div>
