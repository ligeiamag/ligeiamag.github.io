<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When I come home from Sunday School I go</p>
<p class="poemline">up to my attic bedroom and undress</p>
<p class="poemline">and put on my old clothes and go back down</p>
<p class="poemline">-stairs for lunch. It's bacon and eggs again,</p>
<p class="poemline">like every Sunday, with my parents,</p>
<p class="poemline">who are smoking Lucky Strikes and gulping</p>
<p class="poemline">Sanka and sitting at the table with</p>
<p class="poemline">the big Sunday newspaper between them</p>
<p class="poemline">and the comics separated for me,</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>Dick Tracy</em> and <em>Prince Valiant</em> and <em>Henry</em>,</p>
<p class="poemline">who looks like a cross between Charlie Brown</p>
<p class="poemline">and Popeye but never says a word and</p>
<p class="poemline">neither do I, not until I'm spoken</p>
<p class="poemline">to, which is fine by me, and anyway</p>
<p class="poemline">I've got Jesus on my mind, or rather</p>
<p class="poemline">Miss Hooker, my teacher, who told a good</p>
<p class="poemline">story about Him today. She's got red</p>
<p class="poemline">hair and green eyes and one of them's lazy</p>
<p class="poemline">and turns blue when it wanders away. I</p>
<p class="poemline">wonder if she sees double that way and</p>
<p class="poemline">if so if that bothers her or if God</p>
<p class="poemline">protects her. If He doesn't then He should.</p>
<p class="poemline">And white skin, like John Lennon's piano</p>
<p class="poemline">and suit, and a million freckles on top</p>
<p class="poemline">and I'll bet under her clothes, too&mdash;God bless</p>
<p class="poemline">God. Sometimes when she's telling us about</p>
<p class="poemline">one of those old men or women of God</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I forget where I am in the story</p>
<p class="poemline">and dream up a good one of my own, say</p>
<p class="poemline">that Miss Hooker and I are married and</p>
<p class="poemline">having Sunday lunch together. We sit</p>
<p class="poemline">so close we're practically Siamese twins.</p>
<p class="poemline">We're closer than brothers is what we are.</p>
<p class="poemline">Our sides are touching and it's a good thing</p>
<p class="poemline">she's left-handed and I'm right-, and we sit</p>
<p class="poemline">with the hands we use most to the outside.</p>
<p class="poemline">And it's not lousy bacon and eggs but</p>
<p class="poemline">maybe eggs and potatoes and muffins,</p>
<p class="poemline">and no Tang but real orange juice and not canned</p>
<p class="poemline">or frozen, either, but fresh-squeezed and we</p>
<p class="poemline">shared the squeezing, enough for three glasses</p>
<p class="poemline">full because I always want more, and we</p>
<p class="poemline">don't fool with the paper until after</p>
<p class="poemline">we've eaten. We go back into the bedroom</p>
<p class="poemline">and read it there. We're not wearing our robes</p>
<p class="poemline">&mdash;we don't even have robes&mdash;just underwear</p>
<p class="poemline">and not much of that and all her freckles</p>
<p class="poemline">are like the stars come down from last night's sky</p>
<p class="poemline">to shine from her and for me alone and</p>
<p class="poemline">make me blind but not so blind I can't see</p>
<p class="poemline">to share the Sunday crossword with her. We're</p>
<p class="poemline">smart together and finish it all, word</p>
<p class="poemline">by word, and I mean all the <em>acrosses</em></p>
<p class="poemline">in a row and then all the <em>downs</em>. That's pretty</p>
<p class="poemline">smart. And then we fall asleep and when we</p>
<p class="poemline">wake it's late afternoon and time to dress</p>
<p class="poemline">and go for a walk down by the duckpond</p>
<p class="poemline">or we drive into the city and buy</p>
<p class="poemline">whatever we want whether we need it</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">or not. Then we come home and make supper</p>
<p class="poemline">and do the dishes together and watch</p>
<p class="poemline">TV and yawn a lot and go to bed</p>
<p class="poemline">and dream of each other, how happy we</p>
<p class="poemline">are that we're married and hoping one day</p>
<p class="poemline">for a baby, however they happen,</p>
<p class="poemline">I don't know yet and she hasn't told me</p>
<p class="poemline">but one day when the time is right, or night,</p>
<p class="poemline">she will, she's a good teacher, and I'm not</p>
<p class="poemline">10 to her 25, we're the same age.</p>
<p class="poemline">And so I usually miss the point</p>
<p class="poemline">of whatever Bible story she tells.</p>
<p class="poemline">Today it was young Jesus worrying</p>
<p class="poemline">His folks by sneaking off to the temple</p>
<p class="poemline">and showing the old men how sharp He was.</p>
<p class="poemline">Finally, Mary and Joseph track Him</p>
<p class="poemline">down and ask Him what He's doing there and</p>
<p class="poemline">He says something like, <em>Mom and Dad, don't you</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>know I've got to be in my Father's house? </em></p>
<p class="poemline">Or something like that. So there's a moral</p>
<p class="poemline">to the story&mdash;I'm not sure what it is,</p>
<p class="poemline">I missed that part, but maybe <em>Don't worry</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>your parents&mdash;always leave them a note</em>. And</p>
<p class="poemline">maybe you've got to follow God first, no</p>
<p class="poemline">disrespect intended to them. If I</p>
<p class="poemline">did that to mine they'd kill me, whether I</p>
<p class="poemline">went to the church or the pinball parlor.</p>
<p class="poemline">I'd go to Miss Hooker's but I don't know</p>
<p class="poemline">where she lives. I'd ask her but she might tell</p>
<p class="poemline">me. Then I'd be in one Hell of a fix.</p>
