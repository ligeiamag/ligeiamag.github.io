<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">She turned away from me into the twilight – her muslin</p>
<p class="poemline">so light a blue it faded into the hollow of her throat.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The flutter of her pulse a human’s brilliance.</p>
<p class="poemline">The iron of her will a woman’s brilliance.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">She was the crumb – the sparrow – and the hawk.</p>
<p class="poemline">Who tempted and who turned?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The snake’s a man’s myth anyways.</p>
<p class="poemline">What should I forbid her of myself –</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">my power, my mischief, and my weakness,</p>
<p class="poemline">my nights of honey, my days of endless night.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">How long were hers? – a fistful of rosewater,</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">cardamom & lime, fruit touching the very</p>
<p class="poemline">velvet of its limits.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We ruined one another splendidly.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The little channels of blood at her wrist tasted</p>
<p class="poemline">like musk & mint & hunger itself again.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We fed each other what we could. Cruelty</p>
<p class="poemline">& honey. Her breath against my mouth.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">So if I must taste of death again, well –</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The dirt was cold without her.</p>
<p class="poemline">The twilight a taste of bitterness.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">They do not see I have no more</p>
<p class="poemline">to fear. When she turned towards me</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">& offered me her wrist – I tasted what I could</p>
<p class="poemline">of her life, of my life, for a time. A time.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And a time is all that any of us get.</p>
</div>
