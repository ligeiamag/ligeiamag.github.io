<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In my favorite dream we sit in citrus,</p>
<p class="poemline">an actual grapefruit sky,</p>
<p class="poemline">palms of blood</p>
<p class="poemline">oranges, bare feet in sweet</p>
<p class="poemline">onion grass.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Grass gives me no</p>
<p class="poemline">panic here,</p>
<p class="poemline">I smoke absently & delight in</p>
<p class="poemline">the crackle of the joint’s heart,</p>
<p class="poemline">the little fire in my fingers.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We dance in warm storms,</p>
<p class="poemline">grey skies cut through with yellow melon,</p>
<p class="poemline">hearts opened & wore for umbrellas.</p>
<p class="poemline">We live, oh do we live, in this saccharine mecca.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We hold hands—intimacy, bitches.</p>
<p class="poemline">We eat our own hearts out.</p>
<p class="poemline">We never cry. There is nothing here</p>
<p class="poemline">for tears—not one of us has felt a prick</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of pain. Here I never learned to flinch</p>
<p class="poemline">but I sing with the best of the finches.</p>
<p class="poemline">I fly in a murder</p>
<p class="poemline">of crows. At night I outglow</p>
<p class="poemline">the most supple moon, outshoot all</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the living & dying stars.</p>
<p class="poemline">I break apart Orion’s belt</p>
<p class="poemline">& build myself a house.</p>
<p class="poemline">In my favorite dream I’m an impregnable ghost—</p>
<p class="poemline">no man has ever touched me.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I keep cherries in my ovaries</p>
<p class="poemline">& eat them at my own leisure, plant</p>
<p class="poemline">the pits in the womb of the world.</p>
</div>
