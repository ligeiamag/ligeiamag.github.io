<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Let me see—there was the brief bout</p>
<p class="poemline">of pneumonia at six or seven, the house too big,</p>
<p class="poemline">I asked for a sister. A few cases of bronchitis,</p>
<p class="poemline">weakened lungs from my mother, but no need for an inhaler.</p>
<p class="poemline">My joints hyperextend, no broken bones, but a predicted</p>
<p class="poemline">future of early-onset arthritis. I have stabbed myself trying</p>
<p class="poemline">to dislodge an avocado seed from the flesh. I am prone </p>
<p class="poemline">to high fevers. My father has a bad back but refuses</p>
<p class="poemline">to talk about it, or when he nearly slammed </p>
<p class="poemline">into the sink when it gave out, or in the midst </p>
<p class="poemline">of a storm, refused to swim back to shore.</p>
<p class="poemline">My mother told me that, wanted someone to blame</p>
<p class="poemline">when she said I went crazy like him, acting up</p>
<p class="poemline">all American, and why don’t I take something</p>
<p class="poemline">herbal, don’t I know I’m ruining my liver?</p>
<p class="poemline">I’ve been medicated on-and-off since eighteen.</p>
<p class="poemline">I’m terrified of burns and scalds, I laugh </p>
<p class="poemline">as a coping mechanism, I feel nauseous </p>
<p class="poemline">before a panic attack. I’ve cried on top of men</p>
<p class="poemline">I didn’t want but needed, I’ve been touched at </p>
<p class="poemline">seventeen by a man who didn’t want me when</p>
<p class="poemline">he saw me naked. I’ve worn makeup to bed</p>
<p class="poemline">after sex, but really I cannot sleep next to a body</p>
<p class="poemline">I don’t love, my nerves are alive. There are scars </p>
<p class="poemline">I regret and others I don’t. There are nights I bargain </p>
<p class="poemline">with my body until the mirror makes sense, the breath</p>
<p class="poemline">on the glass my only proof of life. There are nights I lose</p>
<p class="poemline">hours opening my skin, like Narcissus digging for something</p>
<p class="poemline">beneath his own reflection. There are three pills I take</p>
<p class="poemline">before bed, sometimes four. I think I have been numbed</p>
<p class="poemline">pharmaceuticals, but fear the alternative. During emergencies,</p>
<p class="poemline">I am calm: the first time I am pulled over, the first time </p>
<p class="poemline">my sister stiffened and convulsed, her lips turned blue.</p>
<p class="poemline">When I cannot think a complete thought, I blame</p>
<p class="poemline">the drugs instead of my own refusal. I am stubborn</p>
<p class="poemline">when I am sure of love and soft when I want it.</p>
<p class="poemline">My mouth is missing eight teeth, but the gaps are gone,</p>
<p class="poemline">I can hardly remember.</p>
