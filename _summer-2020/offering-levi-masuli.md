<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Outside, the rain.</p>
<p class="poemline">But here you ask for water.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">From eyelash I brushed</p>
<p class="poemline">away the crust of a blistered dream</p>
<p class="poemline">where I was eyeing you</p>
<p class="poemline">pulling something up from a deep well</p>
<p class="poemline">a full cup a drop in my hands</p>
<p class="poemline">shy of spilling, a gift I </p>
<p class="poemline">insist. <em>Here</em>. at least a sip, or it’ll slip</p>
<p class="poemline">and shatter a rain cloud.</p>
</div>
