<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My desensitized was desensitized,</p>
<p class="poemline">and I had a nightmare of monstrous proportions.</p>
<p class="poemline">You were hanging upside down on a cactus bush,</p>
<p class="poemline">crucified, your skin sticky red,</p>
<p class="poemline">your head cradled by thorns.</p>
<p class="poemline">Your fingers had been brutalized,</p>
<p class="poemline">ground like beef.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">There was a plantation house nearby, and I went for help. (Though, surely, you were already dead.) I walked</p>
<p class="poemline">in easily. I took the stairs, because I knew you were on the top floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">On the third landing, a child was sent</p>
<p class="poemline">to tell me to clean my feet.</p>
<p class="poemline">I told him I had</p>
<p class="poemline">or that they’d never been dirty.</p>
<p class="poemline">(I can’t remember which.)</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My feet had been in your prickly garden beneath your bleeding, had stepped in the berries that fell from the</p>
<p class="poemline">cactus bush, that stuck themselves there to the arch of my foot. Before the child came, I ate the berries,</p>
<p class="poemline">hungry, and licked clean my steps.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Your death made me selfish.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">But as the child led me up the stairs,</p>
<p class="poemline">I found myself back out</p>
<p class="poemline">where you were hanging like that—</p>
<p class="poemline">naked, embarrassing me and yourself.</p>
<p class="poemline">It was not long before shame gave way,</p>
<p class="poemline">my immortality threatened by your body’s vitality.</p>
<p class="poemline">And then I feared everyone, everything.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And when I turned around I saw that</p>
<p class="poemline">the child had been sent down from the house</p>
<p class="poemline">with a hook in his back,</p>
<p class="poemline">not because he believed my lie</p>
<p class="poemline">but as a consequence of it.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">(I still carry it in the red of my tongue.)</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I’ve never seen a punishment quite that</p>
<p class="poemline">eloquent or quite that effective;</p>
<p class="poemline">my marveling only stood to emphasize my crime.</p>
</div>
