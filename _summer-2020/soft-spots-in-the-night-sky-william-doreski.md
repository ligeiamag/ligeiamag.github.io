<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The soft spots in the night sky</p>
<p class="poemline">weep galaxies so distant</p>
<p class="poemline">not even giant telescopes</p>
<p class="poemline">can resolve their fuzzy outlines.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">You wonder who would choose to live</p>
<p class="poemline">so far from the nearest Starbucks,</p>
<p class="poemline">so aloof from the art and music</p>
<p class="poemline">superior to life itself.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I suggest that such inhabitants</p>
<p class="poemline">have stalled in their own stone age.</p>
<p class="poemline">They dine on raw meat and drink</p>
<p class="poemline">water so rife with flagella</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">that they vomit every meal</p>
<p class="poemline">and stay trim as ancient Romans.</p>
<p class="poemline">You believe they’re encased</p>
<p class="poemline">in stainless hides and have sex</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">with remote devices cast</p>
<p class="poemline">in plastics easily recycled.</p>
<p class="poemline">You expect them to appear overhead</p>
<p class="poemline">at any moment, waving tentacles</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">equipped with post-digital gear.</p>
<p class="poemline">The night doesn’t keep its secrets,</p>
<p class="poemline">though, and the fierce spillover</p>
<p class="poemline">of creation coughs up sparkles</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of glitter you could scrape up</p>
<p class="poemline">and serve on your best dinnerware.</p>
<p class="poemline">Yes. those galaxies look plush</p>
<p class="poemline">as teddy bears, but their heat,</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">penetrating the spectrum</p>
<p class="poemline">and sifted through millions of light years,</p>
<p class="poemline">could warm us every night in bed</p>
<p class="poemline">if only you relaxed and let it.</p>
</div>
