## Until Now You Had Left Your Sickness by the Road—

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">thick and coarse like the strings on green bananas</p>
<p class="poemline">that your parents would buy, that never ripened,</p>
<p class="poemline">just went straight to mud-brown. Couldn’t even put</p>
<p class="poemline">them into bread. Certain doctors told you that parts</p>
<p class="poemline">of the brain could hold memories that weren’t real,</p>
<p class="poemline">just glimmers of your last imaginary cityscape.</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>But I know this windowpane</em>, you wanted to say,</p>
<p class="poemline">the children’s blood pressure cuff grasping the top</p>
<p class="poemline">of your arm, spindly and hollow as the bones of a bird. </p>
<p class="poemline"><em>I’ve seen those opera houses before</em>. You woke up </p>
<p class="poemline">and felt the loss of the scarf pulled tight around </p>
<p class="poemline">your neck. In your mouth, the lingering taste </p>
<p class="poemline">of warm water with lemon and cinnamon.</p>

## Fault Lines


<div class="u-release my-5">
    <div class="container">
    <div class="stanza">
    <p class="poemline">after the storm that laid the spring to rest / we go in the river turned mugshot gray / like the</p>
    <p class="poemline">cracked skin of the sky / or the coins in a collection box / we push our oars through sandalwood</p>
    <p class="poemline">paste / amidst garlands of dead minnows / either deep below the surface or very very close / I</p>
    <p class="poemline">can’t tell / I’m afraid to touch for fear they will disintegrate / into things I can’t pronounce / for</p>
    <p class="poemline">fear my hands will finish them off for good / now and then I used to dream that I was trapped in</p>
    <p class="poemline">a blue spruce / the kind my mother said was a habitat for hornets / and I could not see them but I</p>
    <p class="poemline">could hear their cadenza / so soft and persistent and aware / I could not move my shoulders / I</p>
    <p class="poemline">could not tell what was touching / and what was unraveling / now and then I used to say delusion</p>
    <p class="poemline">when I really meant arrogance / the delusion is that healing reaches / across the blurred edge of</p>
    <p class="poemline">the soul / across altars only characterized by the offerings we remove / where illness and talking</p>
    <p class="poemline">about illness are siblings anyway / someone tell me I’m making bad decisions again / I’m not</p>
    <p class="poemline">overthinking when I should be / ask me <em>where is it / where is the thing that blooms</em></p>
    </div>

## Barycenters

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The crows tell me that my gods are dead, say</p>
<p class="poemline">that it’s been years since my grace was worth</p>
<p class="poemline">its salt. In a dawn clotted with moths orbiting</p>
<p class="poemline">streetlamps in their sickly glow, there I almost</p>
<p class="poemline">find salvation. <em>You never get used to it, I heard,</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>you just learn not to say anything.</em></p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Most of the time I spent repenting, a moth</p>
<p class="poemline">alighting on the rib of the sky—but who am I</p>
<p class="poemline">without my fraud? The protections I swat</p>
<p class="poemline">like heat-drunk gnats? When my firstborn god</p>
<p class="poemline">swung his axe I knew what it meant: <em>I only invent</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>what I can leave behind.</em></p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A curious thing, to be decanted. To watch</p>
<p class="poemline">the earth chase its tail with hunger, wander damp</p>
<p class="poemline">through reams of sand. When it’s all too much</p>
<p class="poemline">I give my shadow back to the moths, the dawn,</p>
<p class="poemline">the crows and their trawling eyes. <em>Your turn</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>to carry this now</em>. When it’s all too much I watch</p>
<p class="poemline">my lovelost god boil herself to sleep.</p>
</div>
