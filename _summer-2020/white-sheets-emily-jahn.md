<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My mother leaves a rosary</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">on the bush outside our house to stop</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the rain, that constant patter</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">on the dusty sidewalk</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">reminiscent of sizzling</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">vegetables on the stove.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In the summer black</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">birds roost in the trees</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">like little monks, the sound of wind</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">chimes telling time.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">White sheets on my bed, </p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">pressed and washed clean</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">a thousand times, stretched</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">between corners and pulled</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">taut as the clothesline</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">she hangs them from in June.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My father scatters loaves of bread</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">across the backyard for the rabbits,</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and one day my brother</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">shot one with an air rifle. </p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My father cut its screaming off by wrenching</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">its hind legs, resting a boot on its head</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">like a blessing, as if to say</p>
<p class="poemline jahn-indent">hush now.</p>
</div>
