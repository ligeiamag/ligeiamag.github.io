<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In an inner-city block,</p>
<p class="poemline">a woman is flopped on the bed</p>
<p class="poemline">of a third-floor tenement,</p>
<p class="poemline">smeared with blood</p>
<p class="poemline">around the lips, the throat,</p>
<p class="poemline">drawing insects</p>
<p class="poemline">from within the walls,</p>
<p class="poemline">shiny black and brown creatures</p>
<p class="poemline">that squeeze through silent lips,</p>
<p class="poemline">or drop into ear canals.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Elsewhere, the building is alive:</p>
<p class="poemline">staircase trampled by never-ending feet,</p>
<p class="poemline">room above, a cacophony</p>
<p class="poemline">of arguments and chair scrapes,</p>
<p class="poemline">apartment below,</p>
<p class="poemline">an interminable coughing fit,</p>
<p class="poemline">outside, traffic noise</p>
<p class="poemline">and people going places.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The world is no longer her business.</p>
<p class="poemline">The tiny creatures that cling to her skin</p>
<p class="poemline">have more provenance than she.</p>
<p class="poemline">Whoever finds the body</p>
<p class="poemline">uncovers a colony.</p>
</div>
