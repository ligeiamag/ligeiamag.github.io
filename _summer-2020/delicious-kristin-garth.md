<p><em>for Charlie Bucket</em></p>
<br>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Life seems cruel after school reduced priced lunch —</p>
<p class="poemline">bologna, gruel, day old bread munched the way</p>
<p class="poemline">you hope someday to taste chocolate crunch</p>
<p class="poemline">bar — not nibbled, wasted on an unbirthday.</p>
<p class="poemline">Life could be delicious everyday. Pause</p>
<p class="poemline">a moment, wrought iron gate, molecules</p>
<p class="poemline">of chocolate permeate nostrils that cause</p>
<p class="poemline">base belly groans unsatisfied when you</p>
<p class="poemline">get home — cabbage supper boiled, rations spare.</p>
<p class="poemline">Dessert is stories seven share. Invent</p>
<p class="poemline">confections. Hope is chocolate in the air;</p>
<p class="poemline">you can smell it everywhere — torment</p>
<p class="poemline">to those who have forgotten its rich taste,</p>
<p class="poemline">a torture manufactured in this place.</p>
</div>
