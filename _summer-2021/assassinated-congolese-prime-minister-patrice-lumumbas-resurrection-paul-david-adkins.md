<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Some Congolese believe he’ll return one day,</p>
<p class="poemline">a couple teeth missing, perhaps, but otherwise</p>
<p class="poemline">intact,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">drafty from the bullet holes.</p>
<p class="poemline">Other than that,</p>
<p class="poemline">alright.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And he will.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And he has, complete</p>
<p class="poemline">with Mephistophelean beard,</p>
<p class="poemline">vendor T-shirts so befitting</p>
<p class="poemline">the Father of His Country,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">but they wanted him dead and,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">indeed,</p>
<p class="poemline">killed him once.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">He is no Christ,</p>
<p class="poemline">but who’s to say?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Congo in the glory</p>
<p class="poemline">of its uprooting,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">its strip-mined soul,</p>
<p class="poemline">its blood all copper,</p>
<p class="poemline">and diamond eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">His great-grandfather slew Arabs at Nyangwe,</p>
<p class="poemline">oversaw their gleaming skulls.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">He killed a lion with a spear</p>
<p class="poemline">near Lake Kisale.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">With pinched fingers, he lowered</p>
<p class="poemline">the tender heart-strips down.</p>
</div>
