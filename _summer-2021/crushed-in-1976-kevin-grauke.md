When I was in second grade, a brown-haired girl named Camille moved into
our neighborhood. Unlike anyone else's eyes, her green eyes confused me
and yanked at my blood. Sometimes this confusion and yanking was
pleasant, like a secret they shared only with me. Other times it felt
like a dangerously large gumdrop I'd accidentally swallowed. Still other
times, the most confusing times, it felt like both at once, which hurt
and made me angry, but in a way new to me. It wasn't how I'd gotten hurt
and angry when my best friend tore up my homework right before the
teacher picked it up. It was something else, more like a balloon filling
with hot water behind my face.

As a toddler, Camille had fallen into a campfire and burned her left
arm, leaving a wide scar from her elbow to her wrist. Its middle was
smooth and shiny, like a wet beach ball, but its edges were ropy and
knotted. Once when the balloon filled too much and too quickly, pushing
past my aching jaw and down my throat, I told her that her arm looked
like rubber, and I called her Goodyear, which I knew was the name of the
rubber tires on my parents' Volkswagen Rabbit. She had done nothing to
deserve this, not that there was anything she could have ever possibly
done that would have caused her to deserve this. I said those words, but
I didn't understand why. For a moment, the heat and pressure of the
balloon eased, but when she ran inside with tears leaking from her
beautiful green eyes, leaving me alone in her front yard on a hot summer
day, it filled again, but this time it sealed my nose and mouth shut,
just like the time at recess when I fell from the monkey bars and landed
hard on my back, leaving me helpless and unable to breathe, staring at
the pure blue of a Texas sky.
