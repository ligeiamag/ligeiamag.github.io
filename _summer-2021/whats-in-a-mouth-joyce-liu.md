<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">my stomach, empty except for</p>
<p class="poemline">duck tongues.</p>
<p class="poemline">the off-brand Tupperware container, empty except for</p>
<p class="poemline">duck tongues.</p>
<p class="poemline">the pot that’s older than i am, empty except for</p>
<p class="poemline">duck tongues.</p>
<p class="poemline">the heads of the 20-something ducks whose tongues i’ve taken, full except for</p>
<p class="poemline">their tongues.</p>
<p class="poemline">i am the duck tongue queen of this Chinese-Canadian suburb,</p>
<p class="poemline">and the ducks in the river behind my house fear me.</p>
<p class="poemline">i eat duck tongues for breakfast.</p>
<p class="poemline">i will drive 30 minutes to the Asian superstore and back for them.</p>
<p class="poemline">these tongues, these tiny nubs of muscle,</p>
<p class="poemline">marinated in the pepper juice of my mother’s top-secret recipe;</p>
<p class="poemline">they freeze my mouth and set it on fire,</p>
<p class="poemline">tongue on tongue on tongue on</p>
<p class="poemline">tongue on tongue.</p>
<p class="poemline">i could never tie a cherry stem into knots</p>
<p class="poemline">but i can suck the meat off this spur of bone in two seconds.</p>
<p class="poemline">we all find things we’re good at:</p>
<p class="poemline">tying our laces, drawing tomatoes—</p>
<p class="poemline">eating the parts of a duck you never even knew you could cook.</p>
