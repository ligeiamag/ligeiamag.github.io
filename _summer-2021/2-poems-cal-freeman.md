## Yelping the Tegmine
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">It is a cluster in the constellation Cancer</p>
<p class="poemline">and a crab shack near the Shell station on Telegraph Road.</p>
<p class="poemline">The polysemy and the lump crab sandwiches are delicious.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The trains in these parts can hobble your commute, and if your inclination</p>
<p class="poemline">is not to trust lump crab from a shot-and-beer roadhouse,</p>
<p class="poemline">even a well-reviewed one, I don’t blame you.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I recommend the sandwich though. It’s flavorful and fresh,</p>
<p class="poemline">and the area won’t suffer for having hosted you.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">They’ll never buy into your epiphanies, so don’t pretend to have them.</p>
<p class="poemline">The moon is not a skiff with your inky spleen in its paren,</p>
<p class="poemline">and the nearby park is not a closed paren within which</p>
<p class="poemline">you might make a notation about Tycho Brahe’s bare-eyed observations.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">There is a sadness to bisque and beer, which is why I’m suggesting</p>
<p class="poemline">the crab sandwich, the Zeta Cancri signature sandwich.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">They’ll never ask you to Yelp the place either. An old trucker friend</p>
<p class="poemline">of mine lived upstairs after a bad break-up with his ex.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">It’s not much of a story: scotography, x-ray radiography,</p>
<p class="poemline">a couple of boys were whooping it up, writing out the darkness.</p>
<p class="poemline">The false ceiling, the dim lights, the wickerwork like bones.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">It’s a new year. It’s the ecliptic of oil tankers</p>
<p class="poemline">in the eyeline of that long glacial plain.</p>
<p class="poemline">You must keep the big rigs’ occultation in mind and search</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">your blind spot for what you’ve been</p>
<p class="poemline">avoiding all this time as you write the Yelp review.</p>
<p class="poemline">The afternoon’s less dull for the thoughts of stars.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">You don’t have to sit here while you eat.</p>
<p class="poemline">You can take the sandwich to the park and hiss back at the geese,</p>
<p class="poemline">or do the geese honk? I believe it’s both, and they also shit like dogs,</p>
<p class="poemline">so maybe it’s best to dine in and ask for a boilermaker.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Listen for whatever beered-up nonsense echoes down the pine</p>
<p class="poemline">and know there’s a pleasant way of disappearing</p>
<p class="poemline">in such a place without feeling quite alone.</p>
<p class="poemline">If you sit upright in the stool, you can watch the bubbles</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">decamp for foam. It’s a bird’s-eye, not a god’s-eye view</p>
<p class="poemline">from above the ecliptic line the room can get on you.</p>
<p class="poemline">The crab is not endemic to this place; it isn’t what you’d call</p>
<p class="poemline">“To die for,” but as I’ve said elsewhere, it’s very good.</p>
</div>

## Note-Taking While Listening to Liam Clancy Sing “The Dutchman”
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When I take my liver down to the rotten dam,</p>
<p class="poemline">I mix it up</p>
<p class="poemline">with Rotterdam and sling misery</p>
<p class="poemline">like spray along the Zuider Zee.</p>
<p class="poemline">I blinked a time or two</p>
<p class="poemline">at the ho-hum ship replica assembled to scale</p>
<p class="poemline">and loaded in an empty fifth of Cutty Sark.</p>
<p class="poemline">Spike, Butch, Stretch, John John, Cal</p>
<p class="poemline">are a few of the names</p>
<p class="poemline">I’ve lived with.</p>
<p class="poemline">Whereas the captain of Blinkenship went nod</p>
<p class="poemline">like belly-up or cod playing possum</p>
<p class="poemline">on a hook, accordioned and drunk,</p>
<p class="poemline">pseudonyms aren’t nearly as exculpatory</p>
<p class="poemline">as one would hope.</p>
<p class="poemline">An unrequited wave along the docks</p>
<p class="poemline">isn’t worth this brief</p>
<p class="poemline">communion with the gulls or should it be</p>
<p class="poemline">this brief communion with the gulls</p>
<p class="poemline">(I feed them lint from fustian pockets)</p>
<p class="poemline">isn’t worth the unrequited wave</p>
<p class="poemline">along the docks? Whether she believes me</p>
<p class="poemline">or believes in me, if the body is both</p>
<p class="poemline">shadow and penumbra, horologe</p>
<p class="poemline">and geodetic hull, the evening light spills</p>
<p class="poemline">like paint in turgid water?</p>
</div>
