<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Her mother sleeps whenever she can,</p>
<p class="poemline">late afternoons on top of the sheets,</p>
<p class="poemline">light pouring in from the windows with</p>
<p class="poemline">the errands left undone.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">She’s like a church in a mine</p>
<p class="poemline">where work and worship</p>
<p class="poemline">join blistered hands.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And all the little heads come to bow</p>
<p class="poemline">at the edge of her mattress</p>
<p class="poemline">—softer than anything—</p>
<p class="poemline">where miners still dream</p>
<p class="poemline">even after a cave in.</p>
</div>
