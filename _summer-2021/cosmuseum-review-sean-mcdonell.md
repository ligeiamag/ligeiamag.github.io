On a childhood trip to a natural history museum, the name of which I
can't remember, I noticed an officer roping off a corridor. Blocked from
me, that hallway's marble tiles hit the horizon. As my imagination
jumped over the barrier, the real bones around me disappeared,
collapsing like cardboard scenery. My mind fell into what-ifs---maybe
animals had escaped, maybe some collections only opened at night, maybe
there were whole exhibits made of human skin. In *Cosmuseum*, Sean
McDonell has taken a similar imaginative leap to its largest conclusion:
a museum that covers almost all time and space.

*Cosmuseum* is structured as an exploration of this grand museum. For
the most part, a curator guides you in your tour, a voice that is
sometimes curious, sometimes mocking, a scientist amused but not too
impressed by the ciliates under the slide. Not even the ones in charge
seem to know all the facets of how the museum came into being: "The
Museum might have a Director. We don't know. Some museologists believe
that the Director does not exist."

The quote above hints at the real-world parallels that McDonell often
travels beside in this book. And that, in turn, leads to one of
Cosmuseum's great strengths: it's funny.

The absurdity grows from the conflict between the workers and the
elites. For example, when one of the cafeterias becomes inaccessible,
the museum staff begin to starve. They turn to eating the exhibits.
Nothing like chowing down on a zebra.

The punishments are summed up like so: "If someone were to, say, lick a
parrotfish, but got no further, they would be flogged and released with
a warning ... Starvation is no excuse for willful destruction of Museum
property. *Famine* they'll screech, *starvation* ... Ignore them. They
agreed to work overtime, after all."

The text details the museum's issues in this way throughout, and the
argumentative texture helps to ground the more fantastic details, which
McDonell renders vividly. An underwater exhibit has huge crabs that
"graze on the scarlet feathers of Pompeii worms, clinging to billowing
pipes of tectonic gas. Marvelous sharks of the Devonian turn in
lethargic circles amid suspended formations of jelly animals whose
bodies look red and velvety, and whales pursue tentacled monstrosities
and duel with gigantic anomalocarids."

The tour structure of the book allows McDonell to examine different
exhibits in vignettes. The short chapters give the book a quick, easy
pace. There are times when McDonell may have moved on from an
interesting moment too quickly (I'm thinking of a chapter on rooftop
explorers who are the first to experience rain and thought insane
because of their reports)---or an insight is moved beyond
with short expansion ("A lost and found is, in itself, a Museum of stray
possessions"). It says a lot that the book is overflowing with such writing, and this is no different than being on any tour. The
reader will have to accept the guide's pace or be left at the gift shop.

Sometimes the voice switches to second person, and these are often the
most powerful parts of the book. In those moments, you're no longer
hearing about the museum, but being guided yourself. A few times, with
this mix in voice, even the satirical sections on corporate control
present another layer of feeling. In a passage on one of the museum's
oldest exhibits (night itself), McDonell writes:

"You could watch the ducks sleep on the water, you could rob a couple at
knife-point, you could find an empty bench, put a newspaper over your
face, and try to forget yourself in dreams.

It is the night. Yours, until closing time."

Throughout *Cosmuseum* appears the macabre but playful artwork of Sami
Alwani. It is a standout part of the experience and matches the book's
tone (the illustration of the human mold people and their decomposition
is like Junji Ito mixed with Charles Schulz.)

The lists of sights goes on: the upside down hall of houses, an organic
clock with mechanical blood, the punishment dungeons (where the
boundaries have become "unclear")---as you might expect in an endless
museum, there are too many exhibits to go over here.

*Cosmuseum* is Sean McDonell's first book and publisher Andata Express'
first prose release, and it shows great things from both. I'm excited to
see what they do next. For now, you should go and [take the
