## A Tiny Blue Dragon in the Cupboard
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A blue dragon sits atop a jar</p>
<p class="poemline">of tomato sauce in my cupboard</p>
<p class="poemline">covered in cinnamon, cardamom,</p>
<p class="poemline">spiced smoke, an ember amidst pasta</p>
<p class="poemline">and instant mashed potatoes.</p>
<p class="poemline">The creature scuttles across cans of soup,</p>
<p class="poemline">stale bread, finally launching itself onto</p>
<p class="poemline">my shoulder. What does one do</p>
<p class="poemline">in such a situation? I look over at the angular</p>
<p class="poemline">face of micro-fear, a mix of amusement</p>
<p class="poemline">and terror when encountering things like</p>
<p class="poemline">small ghosts or werewolf puppies. But</p>
<p class="poemline">its legs sneak themselves beneath</p>
<p class="poemline">my cheek, nuzzling the scruff of shave-</p>
<p class="poemline">less days. Perhaps dragons behave</p>
<p class="poemline">more like poodles than like chickens with teeth.</p>
<p class="poemline">There are many things I am unsure of:</p>
<p class="poemline">the meaning of dragons, the light in a church.</p>
<p class="poemline">The blue mound curls along my collar-</p>
<p class="poemline">bone and slowly winks itself asleep.</p>
<p class="poemline">I do not know where we go when</p>
<p class="poemline">we dream or when we go in unending</p>
<p class="poemline">sleep. I reach into the cupboard, grab a sack</p>
<p class="poemline">of pecans. I read somewhere that dragons</p>
<p class="poemline">enjoy tree nuts as well as flesh or bone.</p>
<p class="poemline">Curious, I plant one near its slumbered</p>
<p class="poemline">maw. A snaking tongue emerges beneath</p>
<p class="poemline">waking orbs of orange, swallows it whole.</p>
<p class="poemline">I can only hope that what I plant can grow</p>
<p class="poemline">into something that will outlast me, rise</p>
<p class="poemline">above me as dragons over so many myths.</p>

## Smoking Another Joint in the Screened-in Patio
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">marooned in flowers,</p>
<p class="poemline">fully-stocked belly</p>
<p class="poemline">full of jelly and joy</p>
<p class="poemline">un-cloyingly sweet</p>
<p class="poemline">like a just ripe mango</p>
<p class="poemline">or tango performed</p>
<p class="poemline">in the hushed kiss</p>
<p class="poemline">of a guitar, novel</p>
<p class="poemline">in its language,</p>
<p class="poemline">speaks to the bones</p>
<p class="poemline">that move about</p>
<p class="poemline">like an artificial intelligence</p>
<p class="poemline">of always-opening arms,</p>
<p class="poemline">a wake in a storm</p>
<p class="poemline">scorched from living</p>
<p class="poemline">itself or maybe</p>
<p class="poemline">the end of this joint</p>
<p class="poemline">that is waning</p>
<p class="poemline">into nothing</p>
<p class="poemline">like a thief in the night</p>
<p class="poemline">of soundless disappearance</p>
<p class="poemline">where I learn to fly south</p>
<p class="poemline">at a degree east or west</p>
<p class="poemline">to cut off squalls</p>
<p class="poemline">at an angle</p>
<p class="poemline">like a rainbow</p>
<p class="poemline">straddling a fractal</p>
<p class="poemline">encountered on</p>
<p class="poemline">particularly potent LSD</p>
<p class="poemline">the last time I smoked</p>
<p class="poemline">and a sea of salvation</p>
<p class="poemline">sounds like an emptying,</p>
<p class="poemline">but really,</p>
<p class="poemline">it’s the place on 23rd</p>
<p class="poemline">where we played strip poker</p>
<p class="poemline">and learned how</p>
<p class="poemline">to touch again,</p>
<p class="poemline">a complex wave</p>
<p class="poemline">washing over sweat</p>
<p class="poemline">and the bliss of an after,</p>
<p class="poemline">after, we got coffee</p>
<p class="poemline">and I said that I love you,</p>
<p class="poemline">which is a funny thing</p>
<p class="poemline">to say over coffee</p>
<p class="poemline">like a line about angels</p>
<p class="poemline">or light in a church</p>
<p class="poemline">that glows like the end</p>
<p class="poemline">of a moment</p>
<p class="poemline">where lips reach out</p>
<p class="poemline">in prayer</p>
<p class="poemline">for the quiet</p>
<p class="poemline">stillness</p>
<p class="poemline">only found</p>
<p class="poemline">at the outset of forever,</p>
<p class="poemline">an ocean</p>
<p class="poemline">where I hope to be</p>
<p class="poemline">stranded, marooned</p>
<p class="poemline">in flowers,</p>
<p class="poemline">breathing in dream</p>
