<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I want a mellifluous chirper.</p>
<p class="poemline">I want it loud and plump,</p>
<p class="poemline">I want it flighty, I want to fight it</p>
<p class="poemline">until it liquefies.</p>
<p class="poemline">I want its legs long and wings chitlin.</p>
<p class="poemline">I want it fiddling meat-wild rage</p>
<p class="poemline">and I want it bad.</p>
<p class="poemline">When it comes, I’ll be as patient</p>
<p class="poemline">as outfield grass in winter.</p>
<p class="poemline">The hairs on my leaves’ll be as loose as</p>
<p class="poemline">a mum bulb awaiting bees—</p>
<p class="poemline">as a peat bog awaiting peat hogs.</p>
<p class="poemline">When it comes, I won’t clamp down</p>
<p class="poemline">until that scar-pocked coin</p>
<p class="poemline">turns round in the pitch ocean sky.</p>
<p class="poemline">Then I’ll snort it fast as blow.</p>
<p class="poemline">Who cares if I die twice?</p>
<p class="poemline">I’ll digest every last eye and antenna</p>
<p class="poemline">before that panting sniffer comes to spray my feet.</p>
<p class="poemline">I’ll absorb the carnal proteins like Adonis</p>
<p class="poemline">ogling the red frock on a Greek god’s date</p>
<p class="poemline">and my high speed, high def snap of jaw</p>
<p class="poemline">will be your awe-inspiring trauma.</p>
<p class="poemline">This is all for you.</p>
