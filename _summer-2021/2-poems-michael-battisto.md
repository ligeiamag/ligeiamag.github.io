## Flowers in the Wind
<div class="stanza jahn-indent">
<p class="poemline"><em>&mdash;in conversation with the Paul Klee painting of the same title</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I was sure we could give you</p>
<p class="poemline">human shoulders and abdomens.</p>
<p class="poemline">Then you could try having stomachs,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">try eating the world with a mouth</p>
<p class="poemline">instead of abstracting sunlight.</p>
<p class="poemline">Your stigmas already resembled our tracheas,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">your petals could grow into fingers,</p>
<p class="poemline">we could give you little feet</p>
<p class="poemline">to keep beside your roots,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">you could study other forms of dancing</p>
<p class="poemline">besides what the wind showed you,</p>
<p class="poemline">perhaps even come to understand</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the reasons you are in the garden.</p>
<p class="poemline">But no, now that you are almost human</p>
<p class="poemline">all you ever seem to do</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">is follow behind us in the flowerbeds,</p>
<p class="poemline">sipping on our poisons</p>
<p class="poemline">and making long lists</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of your tedious disappointments</p>
<p class="poemline">when we only wish for quiet.</p>
<p class="poemline">In what vases can we keep you.</p>
</div>

## Lady Demon
<div class="stanza jahn-indent">
<p class="poemline"><em>&mdash;in conversation with the Paul Klee painting of the same title</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">oh Lady oh veils shifting</p>
<p class="poemline">oh mouth singing of veins</p>
<p class="poemline">i will speak only your name</p>
<p class="poemline">if you leave me one lung</p>
<p class="poemline">i can keep on being</p>
<p class="poemline">what you take blood from</p>
<p class="poemline">you can make me into</p>
<p class="poemline">a red field in a red frame</p>
<p class="poemline">that your thin legs walk on</p>
<p class="poemline">above me you will lie</p>
<p class="poemline">as your eyes align</p>
<p class="poemline">on my pain made numinous</p>
<p class="poemline">your shapes will be numerous</p>
<p class="poemline">like any other lover</p>
<p class="poemline">your features will shift</p>
<p class="poemline">i will show you my need</p>
<p class="poemline">my life until death</p>
<p class="poemline">i will be painted</p>
<p class="poemline">and firmly mounted</p>
<p class="poemline">on a stretcher</p>
<p class="poemline">your little sin</p>
<p class="poemline">your laughter</p>
<p class="poemline">your caricature</p>
</div>
