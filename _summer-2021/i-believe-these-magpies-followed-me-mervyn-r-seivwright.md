<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">here across the Rhinelands. I heard them</p>
<p class="poemline">before seeing them folic betwixt the bushes</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and trees. Aroused in this house in Schopp</p>
<p class="poemline">village steeply cradled against a hillside</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">buried in thickets of long-legged-bark</p>
<p class="poemline">tall pines and oaks. I have not felt the silence</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I find with only blackbirds and magpies</p>
<p class="poemline">harmonizing songs through this late morning,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">an assembly of tranquil blend of bleeps, beeps</p>
<p class="poemline">away from society’s noise, a city gathering—</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">is a wind away. Wind gathers whistles here.</p>
<p class="poemline">The silence tempts a yellow-eyed white cat</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">on my windowpane realizing this house</p>
<p class="poemline">is not empty. I tell the cat, “Guten morgen!”</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Greeting this cat as I am new in this place,</p>
<p class="poemline">a house peering into a valley, listening. I do</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">not have a phone app for translating</p>
<p class="poemline">the yellow-eyed white cat, birds, buzzing</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">flies, bees, or my breathing. I have not heard</p>
<p class="poemline">my breath in years.</p>
</div>
