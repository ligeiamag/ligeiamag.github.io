<p class="poemline">above our hearts or keep them : safe in our bras : where they grow warm : sticky with sweat bite</p>

<p class="poemline">you i would bottle that show : use all the magic i have : cork it : put it on a silk thread : to wear</p>
<p class="poemline">around your neck soft : & thin as a bird’s : i’m sorry : i can’t : sorry : all i have for you are these</p>
