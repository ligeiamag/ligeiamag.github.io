## My Heart
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a rusty pump recycling the same shit through my veins again and again and again.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a house with no doors and no windows, and inside is a man with a telescope.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a gust of wind that spins leaves and garbage together in one whirlwind without a</p>
<p class="poemline">care for the difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a teacher speaking backwards to a room full of students facing the wrong way.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is beautiful and gives good lap dances, and she’ll be happy to dance for you, but it will</p>
<p class="poemline">cost you a lot and you can’t touch her.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a movie where all the roles are played by the same actor.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a basket of fruit where the bananas are still green but the oranges are rotted to</p>
<p class="poemline">mush.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a guitar played like a violin.</p>
<p class="poemline">My heart is one of those inflatable tube men at used car lots who dance when they are puffed</p>
<p class="poemline">up with air but otherwise melt into a puddle of plastic.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a drug dealer loitering outside of a middle school.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a hermit crab making a home in a sandcastle.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a pack of wolves with no teeth, a herd of deer with no legs.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is one of those fault lines that constantly slips and causes a hundred earthquakes a</p>
<p class="poemline">day, but they are all so small that nobody notices, and everyone goes along with their lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a glass pitcher that I keep dropping onto the floor of a room crowded with dancers.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a storm cloud with crackling lightning and pounding thunder, but never any rain.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a top that never stops spinning.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a car that runs but stays parked in the driveway, and when you hop into the driver’s</p>
<p class="poemline">seat, the only thing you can do is listen to the radio.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a gangly man in a trench coat who exposes himself to joggers at the park.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is an octopus stuffed into a mason jar.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a vending machine that eats quarters and then keeps the candy for itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a cloud that sometimes looks like a horse and sometimes looks like a heart and</p>
<p class="poemline">sometimes looks like a phallus and sometimes looks like nothing at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a prism that shoves the whole spectrum into one dull ray of light.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is an old man playing chess against himself, and who always loses.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a schoolyard bully who shoves a nerd into a trashcan and then writes poetry in the</p>
<p class="poemline">dark.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is the cross and the man nailed to it and the crown of thorns on his head and the</p>
<p class="poemline">soldier jabbing the spear into his side and the jeering crowd and the God who just watches.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My heart is a muscle that pumps blood through my body and nothing more.</p>
</div>
