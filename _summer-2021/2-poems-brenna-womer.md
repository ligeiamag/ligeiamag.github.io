## shitty father’s day poem
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">did you know there’s a species</p>
<p class="poemline">of male fruit bat that lactates</p>
<p class="poemline">so the female doesn’t grow</p>
<p class="poemline">too heavy with milk to fly,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">or that flamingos agree on a nesting</p>
<p class="poemline">site together and equally share</p>
<p class="poemline">in their eggs’ incubation time;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">did you know my father left</p>
<p class="poemline">a few days after I was cut into the world,</p>
<p class="poemline">that my mother healed alone while he</p>
<p class="poemline">was playing keeper at a soccer tournament,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">or that my husband was held by his neck</p>
<p class="poemline">up a wall as a child for being a child,</p>
<p class="poemline">his father a handsome, devout, christian man.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the male midwife toad gestates</p>
<p class="poemline">beneath the skin of his back legs,</p>
<p class="poemline">and others carry offspring, instead,</p>
<p class="poemline">in the wet of their mouths;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">how hard it must be for the busy</p>
<p class="poemline">new father not to swallow</p>
<p class="poemline">his eager little tadpoles whole.</p>
</div>
