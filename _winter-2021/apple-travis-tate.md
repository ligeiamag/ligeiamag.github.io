<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I ate an apple today.</p>
<p class="poemline">& now that I think about it,</p>
<p class="poemline">I’ve eaten an apple every day this week.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">& life is suddenly in front of me</p>
<p class="poemline">but also behind me.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The man at the bar says</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>we been through this before</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">& lets me into the crowded room</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">& I think <em>well no this is a good thing</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Andy suggests we leave,</p>
<p class="poemline">the crowd finding little spaces to move</p>
<p class="poemline">in between us like villainous snakes</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">when really we’re just here to talk quietly about</p>
<p class="poemline">this little den of massacre called America</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">& we find some place where our knees touch under the tables.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Then, there is, oh god,</p>
<p class="poemline">a terrible and swift feeling</p>
<p class="poemline">in the pit, down like near the liver, underneath</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">because, I tell Leah that I like a guy, man,</p>
<p class="poemline">beard, bread-eating little devil, red</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">because maybe, he grabbed my arm while he kissed me.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Or, I’m deep in the chasm of wanting</p>
<p class="poemline">for anything,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">like two mated penguins</p>
<p class="poemline">except one of them has died</p>
<p class="poemline">& it’s really time for them to move on.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">& then I realize the apple isn’t enough.</p>
<p class="poemline">& these feelings are good</p>
<p class="poemline">& to hurt with longing is to</p>
<p class="poemline">seize the means of production</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">& feeling</p>
<p class="poemline">wiped out,</p>
<p class="poemline">mauled over,</p>
<p class="poemline">tapped down</p>
<p class="poemline">or</p>
<p class="poemline">any of the above</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">is the simplest way</p>
<p class="poemline">to enact change</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">& the bloodied body is new & simple</p>
<p class="poemline">& is rising above</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">what?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I’m not sure but</p>
<p class="poemline">I drink water slowly,</p>
<p class="poemline">listening to a French man</p>
<p class="poemline">fix the old wooden doors</p>
<p class="poemline">to my house.</p>
</div>
