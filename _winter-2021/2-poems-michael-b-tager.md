## Justin Bieber, as Dalmatian
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Are you skittish? Are you too big</p>
<p class="poemline">for your own good?</p>
<p class="poemline">Too pretty?</p>
<p class="poemline">I know people want to wear your skin</p>
<p class="poemline">and make you into a coat</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Not me</p>
<p class="poemline">That would be creepy</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I know your spots change color with the solar</p>
<p class="poemline">wind, that your hips are bear traps</p>
<p class="poemline">and your ears filled with songbirds</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I can’t imagine you as housedog</p>
<p class="poemline">you belong outside</p>
<p class="poemline">grinning in the summer rain</p>
</div>

## Justin Bieber, as Angel of Vengeance and Atonement
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">What color is your hair</p>
<p class="poemline">beneath your designer cowl?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Your hand freezes</p>
<p class="poemline">my elbow when you guide me with</p>
<p class="poemline">your gold-covered fingers</p>
<p class="poemline">frosted with icicles</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">You lead me through caverns slicked with underground rain</p>
<p class="poemline">and you hum a few bars</p>
<p class="poemline">Want to hear my new track, you ask</p>
<p class="poemline">I say yes, obviously</p>
<p class="poemline">and the music echoes</p>
<p class="poemline">it’s a tight beat</p>
<p class="poemline">the hook is big and sexy</p>
<p class="poemline">like it always is</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Thanks for beliebing</p>
<p class="poemline">you say</p>
<p class="poemline">Now let’s get going</p>
<p class="poemline">because everyone you miss is here</p>
<p class="poemline">and everyone you don’t miss too</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">But, but but, I say</p>
<p class="poemline">I don’t have the heart to tell you</p>
<p class="poemline">I’m only a casual fan</p>
<p class="poemline">So I lock my words behind a wall of silence</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">You say, Don’t worry</p>
<p class="poemline">you’ll be warm. It’s quiet here.</p>
<p class="poemline">It’ll be like your mother’s embrace</p>
<p class="poemline">and we have all the cable channels</p>
<p class="poemline">and all my songs available</p>
<p class="poemline">to stream</p>
</div>
