<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I keep the cold metal</p>
<p class="poemline">of these memories,</p>
<p class="poemline">the only way back inside</p>
<p class="poemline">because I am not ready</p>
<p class="poemline">to let go when my family</p>
<p class="poemline">packs up and leaves the final home</p>
<p class="poemline">from my childhood. Here,</p>
<p class="poemline">fir trees hunch forward</p>
<p class="poemline">after heavy snow, a striking beam</p>
<p class="poemline">of sunlight cuts through the slider</p>
<p class="poemline">at dawn, and summer’s heat</p>
<p class="poemline">drips like butter dipped lobsters</p>
<p class="poemline">boiled in the backyard</p>
<p class="poemline">where we buried our first pet, Kitty.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The key still unlocks the side door</p>
<p class="poemline">in my mind and lets out</p>
<p class="poemline">a familiar groan as it peels open</p>
<p class="poemline">to reveal them all bellowing inside—</p>
<p class="poemline">my mom and dad, together,</p>
<p class="poemline">my grandfather, alive,</p>
<p class="poemline">our second cat’s soft gray fur</p>
<p class="poemline">rising and falling in her sleep</p>
<p class="poemline">before the fisher cat claimed her.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I can only visit from the outside</p>
<p class="poemline">like a ghost, a blanket of white moonlight</p>
<p class="poemline">stretches across the grass, salt air unfurls</p>
<p class="poemline">like a whisper from the shoreline,</p>
<p class="poemline">and the bones of our dead cats’ dissolve,</p>
<p class="poemline">turning over and over each season</p>
<p class="poemline">into dirt so fine it’s as if they</p>
<p class="poemline">were never there at all.</p>
</div>
