## Satellite, Unblinking
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Watch me, I can disappear</p>
<p class="poemline">as a moon through your bedroom door,</p>
<p class="poemline">as flickering features</p>
<p class="poemline">in half-light super-8</p>
<p class="poemline">against the wall,</p>
<p class="poemline">paper we peeled and left to lie,</p>
<p class="poemline">plaster all moonlike and crushed</p>
<p class="poemline">through your bedroom window,</p>
<p class="poemline">I hung from the tree there, once,</p>
<p class="poemline">legs round a branch and blood</p>
<p class="poemline">pulled to forehead, and you</p>
<p class="poemline">called me names until the moon</p>
<p class="poemline">blinked again, watch me</p>
<p class="poemline">as I light a crater</p>
<p class="poemline">and sleep into the sky.</p>

## Tower, My Beautiful Child
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Purple flaming cloth blistering skin under plastic</p>
<p class="poemline">wrap, ink, evaporate into flared nostrils,</p>
<p class="poemline">bloodstream, turn black and flow a dead</p>
<p class="poemline">sea, salt sear scarred flesh, my knees melt</p>
<p class="poemline">into the floor where the guests</p>
<p class="poemline">dance and lie and writhe and drink</p>
<p class="poemline">of my essence so I become the body of us, and we tower</p>
<p class="poemline">over humanity’s creations, a slow concrete beast</p>
<p class="poemline">crawling down the main street, a trail of civilizations</p>
<p class="poemline">left behind, pottery smashed, yeast sleeping in ancient clay,</p>
<p class="poemline">waiting for the clouds, we drink of the collective</p>
<p class="poemline">broth bubbling among our followers, hands raised</p>
<p class="poemline">to the sky which is me which is we</p>
<p class="poemline">and we cast our dice into the crowds,</p>
<p class="poemline">screams rise us above the clouds,</p>
<p class="poemline">screams below rise screams into floods,</p>
<p class="poemline">the Earth is rotten, your body is rotten,</p>
<p class="poemline">we will be your salvation, can you feel us building in</p>
<p class="poemline">your throat, unhinge your jaw and spew us onto</p>
<p class="poemline">the brown carpet, it will hide the stains,</p>
<p class="poemline">your hair will be thick with the smell of our black ink</p>
<p class="poemline">and blistered skin, hide it under plastic wrap, your pain is</p>
<p class="poemline">clouded, feel us no longer in you, feel your cords now in us and</p>
<p class="poemline">crawl down the main street with us,</p>
<p class="poemline">cast your dice with us,</p>
<p class="poemline">tower over humanity with us</p>
<p class="poemline">my beautiful child.</p>
