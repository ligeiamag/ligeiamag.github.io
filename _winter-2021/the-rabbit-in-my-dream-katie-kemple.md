<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">appeared at the end</p>
<p class="poemline">of my parents’ driveway,</p>
<p class="poemline">human sized, grey—</p>
<p class="poemline">her eyes fixed on me.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I used to drag the trash cans</p>
<p class="poemline">there at dusk, the wheels</p>
<p class="poemline">spitting gravel at the lilac trees.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Our last spring as a family,</p>
<p class="poemline">we would take turns</p>
<p class="poemline">walking our mother</p>
<p class="poemline">up the stairs, her purple feet</p>
<p class="poemline">nestled in the carpet.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">And our cat found that</p>
<p class="poemline">litter of rabbits, and carried</p>
<p class="poemline">each kit to our doorway,</p>
<p class="poemline">like a mother. How did she</p>
<p class="poemline">know we liked them alive?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Each beating puff blind,</p>
<p class="poemline">breathing peacefully,</p>
<p class="poemline">unlike our mother dying</p>
<p class="poemline">in her bed upstairs. We</p>
<p class="poemline">walked each back to the nest</p>
<p class="poemline">by the broken fence.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Mother rabbits are absent</p>
<p class="poemline">most of the time. They only</p>
<p class="poemline">visit once a day. What I’m</p>
<p class="poemline">trying to say is—the rabbit</p>
<p class="poemline">in my dream, was visiting me.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My eyes opened, then closed.</p>
<p class="poemline">I was back in the nest of my brain.</p>
</div>
