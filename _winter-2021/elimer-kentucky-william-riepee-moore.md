<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I have come to the backwaters</p>
<p class="poemline">through the brotherhood of the briar</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and the fellowship of biscuits</p>
<p class="poemline">and squirrel gravy at table</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">for everyone, leastways them</p>
<p class="poemline">who finds the way to come.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">If I look back well enough I</p>
<p class="poemline">can just remember cannon fire</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">still vibrate my bones, ‘cause,</p>
<p class="poemline">well, <em>Blood will tell</em>, as they say.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">These are the stonegrave days</p>
<p class="poemline">before the advent of resurrection:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">bluets, daffodils, and squirrel corn—</p>
<p class="poemline">precursors to divine forthcomin’.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Here, it is Easter Eve. Windstir in</p>
<p class="poemline">wild mustard is light on open water</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">that laps newgrowth gone blind</p>
<p class="poemline">to the currents in the sky.</p>
