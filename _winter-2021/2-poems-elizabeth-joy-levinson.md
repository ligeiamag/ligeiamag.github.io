## This is a wet dream
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We tracked the monitor lizard to the roadside,</p>
<p class="poemline">where it was lost in the trees,</p>
<p class="poemline">a rabbit crossed the street</p>
<p class="poemline">a hundred yards away,</p>
<p class="poemline">we thought we had found him,</p>
<p class="poemline">we were disappointed.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We missed his tongue,</p>
<p class="poemline">how it flicked away</p>
<p class="poemline">the dust from his face</p>
<p class="poemline">the salt on his nostrils.</p>
<p class="poemline">We missed the hard look of his tail,</p>
<p class="poemline">braided nickel</p>
<p class="poemline">polished to a fine sheen,</p>
<p class="poemline">that keen head, pointed</p>
<p class="poemline">embedded with dark spinels,</p>
<p class="poemline">set by a jeweler’s able hands.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I want to wrap him around my neck,</p>
<p class="poemline">to come close to the stranglehold,</p>
<p class="poemline">to draw attention to my collar bone,</p>
<p class="poemline">to draw you a picture.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I love you like the lizard</p>
<p class="poemline">we lost in the woods,</p>
<p class="poemline">I’m basking on the rocks,</p>
<p class="poemline">in a sunny space between the trees</p>
<p class="poemline">and I’m waiting.</p>
</div>

## Nineteen
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We threw our bottles off the roof,</p>
<p class="poemline">into the neighbors pool below,</p>
<p class="poemline">what did it matter and why?</p>
<p class="poemline">There was nothing else to do. We could drink</p>
<p class="poemline">until the and until the</p>
<p class="poemline">something became so much easier</p>
<p class="poemline">to swallow, I’m not sure what it was, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I thought I understood their hope,</p>
<p class="poemline">or that somewhere, we were the same. I spoke</p>
<p class="poemline">in short skirts and tight sweaters, what I wanted</p>
<p class="poemline">was as little a question as I could make it.</p>
<p class="poemline">Until the and until the</p>
<p class="poemline">question changed, the wanting changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We did not stop with bottles,</p>
<p class="poemline">we destroyed the neighbors pool,</p>
<p class="poemline">whole buckets of roof tar</p>
<p class="poemline">flung deftly by your strong arms,</p>
<p class="poemline">drummer’s arms. You busied them</p>
<p class="poemline">on destruction, I twisted my thumbs</p>
<p class="poemline">up in my hem. I cursed and laughed</p>
<p class="poemline">like a man. I think that night, I slept alone.</p>
</div>
