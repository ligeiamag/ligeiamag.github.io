## The Reflection on the Pool at the Court of the Myrtles
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>Alhambra, Granada, Spain</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The rain without warning</p>
<p class="poemline">breaks my reflection</p>
<p class="poemline">into El Greco longevity,</p>
<p class="poemline">eyes ascend long and thin</p>
<p class="poemline">to heaven in flickering impressions.</p>
<p class="poemline">A young girl dances solea,</p>
<p class="poemline">hands tracing “Allah”</p>
<p class="poemline">in Moorish calligraphy</p>
<p class="poemline">over the heads</p>
<p class="poemline">of swimming goldfish light.</p>
<p class="poemline">God in the detail,</p>
<p class="poemline">or a god in the detail?</p>
<p class="poemline">Three young brothers pose in what</p>
<p class="poemline">comes back from water</p>
<p class="poemline">as the image of Brahma</p>
<p class="poemline">four heads, four arms,</p>
<p class="poemline">and Goya’s Saturn,</p>
<p class="poemline">devouring offspring</p>
<p class="poemline">and eternity.</p>
<p class="poemline">There is no city</p>
<p class="poemline">that devours eternity</p>
<p class="poemline">like Granada.</p>
<p class="poemline">Soon, all reflections disappear.</p>
<p class="poemline">What remains are the senseless,</p>
<p class="poemline">random turns of goldfish.</p>
</div>

## My hiding son
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Hiding from lost house keys,</p>
<p class="poemline">from curls fallen from homemade haircuts swirling on orange carpet,</p>
<p class="poemline">from unplugged wires seeking their place in the galaxy,</p>
<p class="poemline">from the baseball he can’t wrap his fingers around,</p>
<p class="poemline">dropped and forgotten near the refrigerator in favor of a cherry popsicle,</p>
<p class="poemline">from baby sister’s bottle nipple pointing towards the</p>
<p class="poemline">fuse box that connects clean teeth to itchy fingers,</p>
<p class="poemline">from the steak knives his mother left out on the kitchen table,</p>
<p class="poemline">telling me to stay away,</p>
<p class="poemline">from promises I could not keep thanks to my diabetes,</p>
<p class="poemline">anxiety, insomnia, and cowardice,</p>
<p class="poemline">from the puppy that scratched his hand last week in mutual excitement,</p>
<p class="poemline">from last night’s fireworks outside his window</p>
<p class="poemline">and the windless night carrying sulfur into today.</p>
<p class="poemline">What is that humming sound coming from the kitchen sink,</p>
<p class="poemline">my boy’s hiding place?</p>
<p class="poemline">Come out, show yourself my son.</p>
<p class="poemline">There is a cricket in the garage who wants to meet you.</p>
<p class="poemline">His voice is the truce between the earlier explosions and the quiet.</p>
<p class="poemline">Come my son, listen to the cricket, who keeps perfect time,</p>
<p class="poemline">like your heart when the fear is gone.</p>
<p class="poemline">I hope, for both our sakes, the next decade is not too loud.</p>
<p class="poemline">I hope, for both our sakes, that time is kept perfectly.</p>
</div>
