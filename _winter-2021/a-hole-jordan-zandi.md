<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">As the crowd assembles</p>
<p class="poemline">a man in a bowler announces that the time has come</p>
<p class="poemline">and the angels of the shore drift up and down.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Soon it will rain, and the crowd, two by two</p>
<p class="poemline">will be called to cross the village green.</p>
<p class="poemline">They’ll pass beside the butcher’s shop</p>
<p class="poemline">and wave sad kerchiefs to the hanging pigs.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When they come to the sea, up the gangplank they’ll flow</p>
<p class="poemline">into the rusted ironclad, each feeling happy now</p>
<p class="poemline">since this must signal the arrival of the end—</p>
<p class="poemline">as if between tomorrow and yesterday</p>
<p class="poemline">were not the day they’re living in.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The procession past, the last will come, the slowest one.</p>
<p class="poemline">With her cane she’ll tap the gangplank</p>
<p class="poemline">as if testing ice on a frozen lake.</p>
<p class="poemline">The last is Gladys, whom I have come to love</p>
<p class="poemline">she who in the future says, “Ah, that—</p>
<p class="poemline">That was hardly the end.”</p>
</div>
