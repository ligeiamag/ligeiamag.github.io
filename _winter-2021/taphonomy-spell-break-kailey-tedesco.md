<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">you know best—i waver, unquivered in my sleep-</p>
<p class="poemline">sack, i bring you to the abandonment i created,</p>
<p class="poemline">the sweet dirt in my palms & hair, all of me</p>
<p class="poemline">serrated in graves. i knew a man to call a father,</p>
<p class="poemline">briefly, & then another. <em>speakofthedevil</em> comes up</p>
<p class="poemline">from the skull-wings, kisses me again & again</p>
<p class="poemline">in my makeshift bed shared with children</p>
<p class="poemline">by the dozen. i doze here in the boneyard,</p>
<p class="poemline">make soup-broth out of dead-breath. an extraordinary</p>
<p class="poemline">baker, i can savor flavors of the after, the carvings</p>
<p class="poemline">done in sand, all our names destined to be cemented,</p>
<p class="poemline">to be storied, & then to be resurrected in error.</p>
<p class="poemline">if you didn’t know already, i’m casting a spell</p>
<p class="poemline">on you, dearly beloved. <em>speakofthedevil</em> is coming—</p>
<p class="poemline">it’s supper, or else, it’s nuptial. i welcome birth,</p>
<p class="poemline">but unlike death, i can’t perform it on my own.</p>
