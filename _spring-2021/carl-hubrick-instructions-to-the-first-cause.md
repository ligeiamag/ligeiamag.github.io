<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Find a great space somewhere,</p>
<p class="poemline">and light giant stars in it.</p>
<p class="poemline">Create matter and shape planets,</p>
<p class="poemline">and as each is finished—spin it.</p>
<p class="poemline">Bestow an atmosphere to some,</p>
<p class="poemline">add a little warmth and water.</p>
<p class="poemline">Now sow the seeds of life</p>
<p class="poemline">and sit back and watch</p>
<p class="poemline">the slaughter.</p>
</div>
