<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">You once asked if I would sleep</p>
<p class="poemline">on your grave. It’s a moving scene,</p>
<p class="poemline">I admit. How I would crawl, eyes raw</p>
<p class="poemline">and infant pink, lips aquiver. How I would pull</p>
<p class="poemline">myself atop the mound scarred with shovel</p>
<p class="poemline">thwacks and press my face into the earth</p>
<p class="poemline">packed like spent coffee grounds. I would let</p>
<p class="poemline">the loam mold my form, wear my shape</p>
<p class="poemline">like a family crest. I would pretend that we were</p>
<p class="poemline">in our bed and explain my cold and lonely</p>
<p class="poemline">by you stealing the duvet. The shifting</p>
<p class="poemline">of the earth beneath me would be you</p>
<p class="poemline">rolling over. I would play for myself</p>
<p class="poemline">the soundtrack of your snores and night wuffles.</p>
<p class="poemline">I would know that the dead don’t stay</p>
<p class="poemline">still or quiet. I would imagine your fingers</p>
<p class="poemline">tunneling towards air. If you emerged,</p>
<p class="poemline">horrible and hungry, I would give</p>
<p class="poemline">myself to you freely. I would consent</p>
<p class="poemline">to be consumed. The least I could do.</p>
<p class="poemline">I would not mourn how you deserve.</p>
<p class="poemline">Do you see? I look and look,</p>
<p class="poemline">but you are never quite there.</p>
<p class="poemline">You are a call that stops ringing the second</p>
<p class="poemline">I get inside the door. You are a message</p>
<p class="poemline">in sand at high tide. You are a robin’s first</p>
<p class="poemline">flight in my guts when I see a blonde head</p>
<p class="poemline">or bones in a ravine, an architect’s model for life.</p>
<p class="poemline">I carry crumbs to lead you home. In dreams</p>
<p class="poemline">I follow, branches fray my hair like cobwebs,</p>
<p class="poemline">burrs sequin my socks. A shadow, a boot print.</p>
<p class="poemline">Are you there? Is there anything to bury?</p>
