<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">born on the horizon line</p>
<p class="poemline">an east coast baby cries</p>
<p class="poemline">she is black</p>
<p class="poemline">onyx spirit of soft stone</p>
<p class="poemline">malleable as clay</p>
<p class="poemline">candy coated flesh</p>
<p class="poemline">of sienna lacquer divine</p>
<p class="poemline">her mind clear even</p>
<p class="poemline">in the balance of her</p>
<p class="poemline">queer nature women & men</p>
<p class="poemline">divine & divided equally</p>
<p class="poemline">into a desire of both of one</p>
<p class="poemline">blessed beloved</p>
<p class="poemline">full-bodied flavorful design</p>
<p class="poemline">thick lips hips & legs</p>
<p class="poemline">short-stacked among giants</p>
<p class="poemline">when she falls she falls deep</p>
<p class="poemline">deep in voids with a mouth</p>
<p class="poemline">open wide wider widen</p>
<p class="poemline">long fevers of growing old</p>
<p class="poemline">yet forever the baby will</p>
<p class="poemline">cry in a fog of memory</p>
<p class="poemline">wait for the respite</p>
<p class="poemline">burning off bright by</p>
<p class="poemline">the rising sun</p>
</div>
