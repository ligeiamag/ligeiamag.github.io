<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The first time,</p>
<p class="poemline">he tried to stop it.</p>
<p class="poemline">He pressed his suffering shoulder</p>
<p class="poemline">against the rough stone</p>
<p class="poemline">and dug his heels deep.</p>
<p class="poemline">You can still see the traces</p>
<p class="poemline">like wheel ruts left</p>
<p class="poemline">by forgotten chariots.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The next million times</p>
<p class="poemline">he raced it</p>
<p class="poemline">to the valley floor thinking</p>
<p class="poemline">he might catch it,</p>
<p class="poemline">might put an end to things.</p>
<p class="poemline">The footprints trace</p>
<p class="poemline">both sides of the path.</p>
<p class="poemline">He could never settle on one.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Now, he just watches it.</p>
<p class="poemline">He judges the sound,</p>
<p class="poemline">the quality of the rumble,</p>
<p class="poemline">praying for erosion.</p>
<p class="poemline">Then he raises his tired bones</p>
<p class="poemline">and starts his slow walk</p>
<p class="poemline">to the foot of the hill.</p>
<p class="poemline">There’s no reason not to.</p>
</div>
