## Letters to friends and enemies
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I now sit down to tell you how I get along:</p>
<p class="poemline">I am well and hope these lines find you the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I hope these lines find you at the mailbox</p>
<p class="poemline">savagely ripping open the envelope, dying to know the news.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I hope this letter is served to you on a silver platter</p>
<p class="poemline">by a servant interrupting the saddest dinner party in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I hope this letter finds you in a suburban bathrobe</p>
<p class="poemline">waiting for the family shower to be free</p>
<p class="poemline">listening to Cowboy Junkies in the yellow kitchen.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I hope it finds you dreamy, reminiscing</p>
<p class="poemline">about tongues of talented ex-lovers.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I hope this letter finds you crying at the sink</p>
<p class="poemline">turned away from the room</p>
<p class="poemline">hands floundering in warm, sudsy water.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I hope it finds you changed, altered</p>
<p class="poemline">like in the hours and days after the Mahler concert.</p>
<p class="poemline">Quieter.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I hope this letter finds you chastened</p>
<p class="poemline">and sober, the morning after a drunken fight</p>
<p class="poemline">where you slapped your only daughter.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I hope it finds you dehydrated.</p>
<p class="poemline">I hope it finds you among kin.</p>
<p class="poemline">I hope it is pink-packed snug among</p>
<p class="poemline">a thousand layers of white business envelopes.</p>
<p class="poemline">Fraternizing.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I hope it sails across the sea in a crate</p>
<p class="poemline">on the slowest, most exquisite container ship</p>
<p class="poemline">piloted by a skeleton crew of fourteen</p>
<p class="poemline">who exchange only a few cursory</p>
<p class="poemline">but heartfelt</p>
<p class="poemline">words a day.</p>
</div>

## Penny dreadful
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Our heroine will stick a long pair of forceps down her throat, way past the gullet to</p>
<p class="poemline">snag the lump of angst that is perpetually lodged in her chest and when the metal tips</p>
<p class="poemline">finally grasp it, she’ll wiggle the slippery thing out, inch by inch, so that we’ll see after</p>
<p class="poemline">all this time that it’s a green crab, pincers waving, alive and vicious, and she’ll throw it</p>
<p class="poemline">into Long Island sound and watch it sink to fading music.</p>
</div>
