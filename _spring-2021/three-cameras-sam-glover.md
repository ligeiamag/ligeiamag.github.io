<p>The security camera commands an aerial view of the long alley. It must
be positioned quite high up on the corner of a building, but not so high
as to render indistinct the area it is aimed at. The area it is aimed at
is an indistinct section of narrow alleyway&mdash;it is difficult to tell
from the footage alone if the camera is aimed toward the beginning, end,
or some intermediate part of this incapacious urban corridor. The camera
is not facing straight down the line of the alley; it is positioned
obliquely, slanted such that on the monitor screen a large portion is
taken up by the unchanging brickwork of the high wall that seems to run
the length of the entire alleyway. The brickwork is almost mirrored by
the flagstones of the pavement; it looks as though they segue neatly
into one another, wall becoming pavement, pavement becoming wall&mdash;except it can be seen, upon closer inspection, that the flagstones are
far less even, far less smooth, far less regular than the brickwork. The
alley's end or beginning is a very distant shadowy opening located at
the top-right-hand corner of the screen. In recording the scene&mdash;in
which things appear paused, nothing occurring for hours&mdash;the camera
converts the low light-levels, the darkness, the artificial glow of a
single far-off streetlamp, into grainy footage that is faintly tinged
with blueish lilac static. Where the light is brightest&mdash;a solitary
dot in the distance&mdash;it has the spectral luminescence of a
glow-in-the-dark children's toy. But where the night is darkest, the
furthest-reaches of the alley for instance, where the camera is unable
to penetrate, the screen is as black as the glass of a switched-off
television. It is thus as if small sections of the screen are faulty, as
if puzzle-pieces have been removed from the image, introducing blank
intervals and gaps. In the bottom-left corner of the screen, the numbers
representing hours, minutes and seconds constantly change, at differing
speeds. It is 03hrs: 26mins: 31secs when the man first appears on the
screen emerging from the top-righthand corner where the image is
darkest. He appears to be in a rush, approaching the vicinity of the
camera at a quick pace, eyes and head lowered. Dressed in a body-length
trench-coat of black material, a suitcase fixed to his side by rigid
arms, he has the bodily dimensions of a column. The unevenness of the
flagstones, their crooked protrusions and cavities, seem to pose no
obstruction to his consistently quick manner of walking. With each step
he takes toward the security camera his appearance increases in detail.
His face is unremarkable, anonymous, plain, but his coat is notable for
the number of buttons it has going down the middle&mdash;more buttons than
is either practical or fashionable. This man passes beneath the camera,
going beyond the fixed area of its purview. It is 03hrs: 28 mins: 55secs
when he disappears off-screen. Once again, the alley appears frozen,
paused, until an hour passes, when at 04hrs: 20mins: 13secs a fox enters
the frame of the security camera; briskly it moves in the opposite
direction to the man in the trench-coat, going toward where he came
from. The fox, watched from behind, becomes smaller and smaller the
further away it gets from the camera-lens; it is drawn to the furthest
end of the alley, toward the area of blackness located at the top-right
corner of the screen, into which, once reached, it disappears.</p>

<p>The security camera presides over a car park empty but for a single vehicle. Whether this vehicle is in use, abandoned or clamped is not
readily apparent. But a disordered proliferation of litter calls into
question whether this is a functioning car park. Here and there upturned
shopping trolleys obstruct the parking bays, but the majority of the
litter seems to be discarded electronics: old boxy computer monitors,
obsolete walkmans and portable CD players, tangled miscellaneous
multi-coloured wires and VCRs in various states of disrepair. The
dilapidation of these broken objects is only accentuated by the
efficient rigour of the slightly faded road markings: the orderly
sequences of straight white lines that delineate the bays, the pictogram
of a stick figure sat on a wheel-chair in profile, the diamond patterns
of criss-crossing yellow lines, the yellow letters: <em>keep clear</em>. The
car park is attached to an unidentifiable commercial building, only the
door of which is in shot, alongside a wide window or loading dock that
is covered up by metal shutters. A small boy in sportswear is stood with
his back to the security camera, kicking a ball against these metal
shutters repeatedly. But on the silent screen the clattering sound this
must make doesn't register. In the bottom-left corner the time reads
04hrs: 02mins: 33secs. The rigid man in the many-buttoned trench-coat
appears on-screen, seen from behind by the camera. His quick stride
comes to an abrupt stop around the middle of the car park, where he
comes to a halt and begins to look around, rotating very slowly on the
spot. There is nothing nearby to account for this puzzling occurrence,
neither the reason for his stopping so suddenly, given the hurried pace
and determination of his progression, nor the even more peculiar fact of
his rotating, as if to get a three hundred and sixty degree perspective
of the surroundings. There is something in the action that is
perfunctory, routine, mechanical and yet, at the same time, ritualistic
in its solemn gravity, its rehearsed character, its apparent necessity,
and the fact it results in nothing evident despite the practice of its
observance. The boy kicking the football has taken no notice of the man
in the dark trench-coat at the centre of the car-park or scrap-yard.
After completing a few rotations, the man heads off again at the same
fast pace toward the door of the commercial building. As soon as he
begins to walk, the door of the sole vehicle in the carpark opens up and
out steps a seemingly identical man in a many-buttoned trench-coat of
black material. This man, however, does not carry a suitcase. He quickly
moves across the car park, closing down the distance between him and the
other man, who is now stood at the door of the commercial building. But
just before he is able to open the door&mdash;on the screen he can be seen
to have his spare-hand around the door-handle&mdash;a ball rolls toward his
feet. The small boy in sportwear is now facing the man with the
suitcase, as the one without gains ground, getting closer and closer to
them both. A gust of interruptive static briefly cuts out the entire
image. When it returns, the boy is once again kicking the ball against
the shutters, but there are no trench-coated men onscreen and the parked
car is gone.</p>

<p>The security camera, from a corner of the ceiling, records the
motionless interior of a small office. The tiled floor is bright and
reflective; it is a grid of large squares that, on-screen, look more
like diamond-shapes given the angle of the camera. A large desk&mdash;of a
curved, crescent moon-shape&mdash;faces away from the lens. There are two
wingback armchairs facing the desk. Between them is a small stand on
which sits a little pile of magazines. On one side of this arrangement,
in a corner, is a water-cooler. On the other side, a glass-panelled door
that permits admission to the office. What can be seen of the hallway
through this glass is indistinct, uncaptured by the camera. At 04hrs:
10mins: 59 secs a dark shape clouds the glass. The door handle appears
to turn several times without opening. Some minutes pass. At 04hrs:
13mins: 02secs the door opens into the office and there appears a man in
a black ankle-length trench-coat that is buttoned up to the neck. He is
empty-handed. Amidst the greenish white hues of the footage he is a dark
presence on the monitor; the angle of the camera, the small size of the
office, or his height, if not all three, make him appear over-sized,
cramped and confined within the room. While his face is unremarkable,
anonymous, plain, it shows signs of weariness and fatigue. Looking about
rapidly, he positions himself somewhere close to the centre of the
office and begins to rotate round and around very slowly. When he moves,
it is with clear strain, as if he is injured or pained. He walks over to
the water-cooler, dispensing the liquid into a small plastic cup that
can be seen in his hand when he turns back around. But rather than
drinking from it, he stands still. Then he turns around, sits in the
armchair that is nearest the door and drinks. Wavering lines of static
pass down the screen and obscure the footage. Two men in trench-coats
are sat in the two armchairs when the image returns. The one nearest the
door has on his lap an unopened suitcase. The one nearest the
water-cooler has in his hand a little plastic cup. Both are staring
straight ahead at the curved crescent-shaped desk. Their mouths never
move. But when the time in the bottom-left-hand corner of the screen
reads 04hrs: 18mins: 45secs, something without definite shape begins to
stir underneath the desk. This would be unseen by the two men, but the
camera records it from behind. Very quickly an animal&mdash;what looks like
a fox&mdash;scurries out from the under the desk, across the tiled floor,
past the legs of the seated men, it leaves the office through the open
glass-panelled door, disappearing into the blackness of the hallway that
is beyond the reach of the security camera. One of the men stands up, he
places the suitcase on the desk. The other stands up empty-handed.
Leaving the office, one follows the other, either visibly fatigued, or
pained. Once in the darkness of the hallway, the glass-panelled door to
the office closes shut. What can be seen of the hallway through this
glass is indistinct, uncaptured by the camera.</p>
