## Back to Rats
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Felt a little sick to my stomach. Slept in jeans.</p>
<p class="poemline">I brushed my teeth with ginger ale and found a rat</p>
<p class="poemline">behind the couch. My mother told me about a killer</p>
<p class="poemline">who hid his bodies in the river. Rats like water too,</p>
<p class="poemline">didn’t you know? I too want to die and go out swimming,</p>
<p class="poemline">flotsam along the stretch of forested interstate highway.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We went for a ride. A sign for a travel agency read</p>
<p class="poemline">PLEASE GO AWAY. I wanted to say LET’S PULL OVER</p>
<p class="poemline">AND STAY but nothing came out of my mouth except</p>
<p class="poemline">some Orbit. An ex-friend said no one really cares</p>
<p class="poemline">about the dead. I was so mad I left the cafe.</p>
<p class="poemline">My family never stops talking about the dead. I never</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">learned to shut my stupid mouth so now I’d like</p>
<p class="poemline">some duct tape. I wish I knew the difference between</p>
<p class="poemline">really liking someone and hoping they won’t die</p>
<p class="poemline">but, then again, who really gets to decide that?</p>
<p class="poemline">It’s the same with rats. There’s some ballet about a princess</p>
<p class="poemline">who hit a rat king with a slipper dead. I laughed.</p>

## Gawain

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The bed is hot. I hold two twigs beneath my pillow</p>
<p class="poemline">and think of him&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;star drunk in a pasture, popping Advil</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whiskey, saddled on his motorbike glowing</p>
<p class="poemline">like a green knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I snap the twigs in four to stow</p>
<p class="poemline">away for later. He sends a photo he took pine logging</p>
<p class="poemline">out of town:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mangled strawberry corpse of a dog</p>
<p class="poemline">whose head he chopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He texts [these broken acts will fetter</p>
<p class="poemline">me, it’ll take my head to fashion debtless debt]</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Green nights like these I feel much like a decapitated</p>
<p class="poemline">body, hands searching the dirt for my face near twigs and three</p>
<p class="poemline">-ply sheets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I text [gawain, i dreamt we were new-tongued]</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Much, much later, he sings outside as I’m falling through</p>
<p class="poemline">the hours, dewdrop skin and tooth, with heavy naked</p>
<p class="poemline">breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocks. What music do our voices make?</p>
<p class="poemline">He enters gripping an axe, then toes his shoes off standing</p>
<p class="poemline">wide, grin white, the dripping canine head in hand.</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say [Put those in the fridge] He does, all sore and heady,</p>
<p class="poemline">wrapping an arm around my ribcage as he sinks in bed.</p>
<p class="poemline">He moves his lips on mine like a burning house caving</p>
<p class="poemline">in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My nails thumb drum on his cymbal heart [Okay,</p>
<p class="poemline">I hate you]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finds the twigs and builds an emerald fire</p>
<p class="poemline">between our breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The folds of shadow burn, nightshy.</p>

## Blank Ghazal
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">This glacial stream falls downward into ice trapped pools, a blank</p>
<p class="poemline">white canvas unmarred by touch and even further down the blank</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">sting of water spills in sheets of blue. This winter is a pale</p>
<p class="poemline">fanged bat that screams and screams to fill in its nightly sheer-eyed blank.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I lie in the backseat while you drive, hands changing radio stations,</p>
<p class="poemline">still cold from touching January ice. The first song is <em>blank</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>space</em>, though static warped. When you sing nothing comes out except</p>
<p class="poemline">a burst of breath and rotten notes, the air all warm and blank</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of conversation. Will we find a noise that’s worth the effort</p>
<p class="poemline">needed to keep on speaking? Answers are means of filling in blanks</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">until we die. I hope when future people unearth me I’m cold</p>
<p class="poemline">enough that I look entirely the same and my tombstone’s rubbed blank</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of my name. What was that stupid thing I was never meant to say?</p>
<p class="poemline">Whenever I try to think, all I get is [ __ ] and [ __ ] and [ __ ].</p>
</div>
