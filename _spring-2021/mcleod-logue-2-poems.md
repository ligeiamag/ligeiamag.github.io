## My Grandfather’s Nose Hair
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">He was a part of the green leather chair,</p>
<p class="poemline">molded to the arm rests, his legs crossed with age</p>
<p class="poemline">like peeling vinyl. He had always been there,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">from what I could remember, and I’d never seen</p>
<p class="poemline">his frame in action. The words he spoke were gospels,</p>
<p class="poemline">breathed from a life of gusto. I could see the nose hair</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">from across the room, white and gentle, sprouting</p>
<p class="poemline">from the end of his nose, and always in motion.</p>
<p class="poemline">It sank with his skin, mourning the loss of a life well lived,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">proud of the generations it had seen come to pass.</p>
<p class="poemline">I dreamed of plucking it free with my bare hands,</p>
<p class="poemline">keeping it in a vase beneath my bed, feeding it war stories</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and tales of youth it no longer devoured. I dreamed</p>
<p class="poemline">of touching it lightly, still attached to the seam of his skin,</p>
<p class="poemline">unzipping his nose and having tea with his brain.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I trusted him with the gospel, with the education</p>
<p class="poemline">of what humanity should look like. I trusted him to teach me</p>
<p class="poemline">how to grow my own nose hair, to sprout gospels from within.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Through a crack in the door, I saw him standing</p>
<p class="poemline">at the bathroom sink, motion lingering in his long skin.</p>
<p class="poemline">He admired himself, checked his teeth for hidden wisdom,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">then plucked the white curl from the end of his nose</p>
<p class="poemline">discarding it as if it were dust.</p>
</div>

## Please Do Not Touch the Projector
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My hands smell like sour dough because I am making</p>
<p class="poemline">sourdough bread, or unmaking, I should say, because the dough</p>
<p class="poemline">is too sour and it is not shaped like bread, but rather like</p>
<p class="poemline">a bird flat in the road. I babysit outside the park</p>
<p class="poemline">because I like to sit and listen to the wind sing, but all I can</p>
<p class="poemline">hear are the children screaming and screaming about the plan</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">or lack thereof and pickleball. I do not know what pickleball</p>
<p class="poemline">is and frankly, neither do they so the screaming keeps until I feed them</p>
<p class="poemline">answers like medicine, down swift and painful, and now</p>
<p class="poemline">they do not see me as an adult. I am not an adult. I cannot bake</p>
<p class="poemline">bread or talk to children or love the way people want me to. I am a girl</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">with unmade bread, unkempt hair, and a distrust for children</p>
<p class="poemline">that I have been told is a feeling projected about myself.</p>
<p class="poemline">I am not a girl, but a projector sitting on the floor of a room with dust</p>
<p class="poemline">collecting on my shoulders and FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY sign</p>
<p class="poemline">covering one of my eyes. I have worn this sticker my whole life. No one</p>
<p class="poemline">minds that it is yellowed and not all that sticky anymore. They use me.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">They use me to watch themselves grow old, to watch their children when</p>
<p class="poemline">they do not want their children, to watch the way I only play</p>
<p class="poemline">one movie over and over and over until the plot doesn’t make</p>
<p class="poemline">sense and the words sound like translations.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">My hands are still here smelling like sour dough and I scrub them</p>
<p class="poemline">until they smell like hands. Hands and soap and sour dough residue.</p>
<p class="poemline">I will watch them scrub themselves until I feel them</p>
<p class="poemline">watching me, watching them.</p>
</div>
