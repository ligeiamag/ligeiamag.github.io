<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The morning a trellis I use to climb</p>
<p class="poemline">into the day, reaching for our only</p>
<p class="poemline">star, the moon a light in the darkness.</p>
<p class="poemline">So much celestial light among</p>
<p class="poemline">the material of us, witnesses to all</p>
<p class="poemline">we have done. <em>Speak stones, tell us</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>what sin of man has hardened you so.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The son of Luis returns after months</p>
<p class="poemline">beyond the border that men have put</p>
<p class="poemline">in their own hearts. The fifth of May</p>
<p class="poemline">every day for a family made whole, made</p>
<p class="poemline">as it always should be. Today, rain</p>
<p class="poemline">will wash away the dust of our labors</p>
<p class="poemline">that collects on our idle vehicles. Tomorrow</p>
<p class="poemline">some storm will remind us all of some</p>
<p class="poemline">heavenly fury we cannot be sure exists.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">How deep goes the light</p>
<p class="poemline">that let eyes see barbed wire, that warned</p>
<p class="poemline">of trouble in twin high-beams like</p>
<p class="poemline">haunted, obsessive eyes. Is it enough</p>
<p class="poemline">to know that we have done this all</p>
<p class="poemline">to ourselves? Tomorrow it could be</p>
<p class="poemline">Mo’s daughter or Pablo’s son. I see this</p>
<p class="poemline">worry in the lines on their faces. <em>Speak soil,</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>tell us what the blood of man tastes like.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In some future the light will calm the spirits</p>
<p class="poemline">of man. In some future, these times are already</p>
<p class="poemline">something the wise have labeled for the ages.</p>
</div>
