<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Unhinge your landing gear</p>
<p class="poemline">in shallow shoals. Scissor</p>
<p class="poemline">air, wings warning,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">webbed feet dredged in silt</p>
<p class="poemline">deep as time, iris tilted</p>
<p class="poemline">skyward, a ringed target</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of defiance. You’re still</p>
<p class="poemline">all pterodactyl beneath</p>
<p class="poemline">those pewter feathers damp</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">as fog. Not even Audubon</p>
<p class="poemline">with palette and brush</p>
<p class="poemline">was able to wrest you</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">from flight. Persistence</p>
<p class="poemline">is nature; to fly, to fight.</p>
</div>
