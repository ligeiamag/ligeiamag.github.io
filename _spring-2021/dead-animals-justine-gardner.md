<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The fridge is currently empty of ghosts:</p>
<p class="poemline">there are no expired pets whose bodies</p>
<p class="poemline">are waiting to be treated</p>
<p class="poemline">with more care and consideration</p>
<p class="poemline">than you give the chunked lamb, the spiralized cow,</p>
<p class="poemline">the slivered salmon, the whole chicken</p>
<p class="poemline">(minus head, feathers, feet, certain organs).</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">There are no cats, no small dogs,</p>
<p class="poemline">sealed in zip-top bags in preparation</p>
<p class="poemline">for you to take them to be burned:</p>
<p class="poemline">moved from freezer to fire to quiet</p>
<p class="poemline">boxes on the shelf, added to your collection</p>
<p class="poemline">of old friends, of dust getting dustier.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The fridge is empty of those ghosts</p>
<p class="poemline">and yet something is rattling inside—</p>
<p class="poemline">perhaps a gerbil is loose</p>
<p class="poemline">in the lettuce bin and asking to come out;</p>
<p class="poemline">perhaps it has eaten all your purple kale</p>
<p class="poemline">and the kohlrabi tucked like river</p>
<p class="poemline">stones under a wash of greener veg.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Perhaps, this evening, when you open the door</p>
<p class="poemline">and reach for the packet of leaking beef</p>
<p class="poemline">the gerbil will creep forward,</p>
<p class="poemline">real and alive and gnashing</p>
<p class="poemline">a fat cabbage worm it wrested</p>
<p class="poemline">from your locally grown cauliflower.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Maybe it will have blood in its teeth.</p>
</div>
