<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The fires are out, mostly, in the streets,</p>
<p class="poemline">just heat laying-on, thick and muscly</p>
<p class="poemline">under ubiquitous blue moon, over outback,</p>
<p class="poemline">too, where no beautiful thing shines</p>
<p class="poemline">in lunar presence as before, and yet,</p>
<p class="poemline">if desert could sense summer, <em>then</em>, like us,</p>
<p class="poemline">of magic and memory, no <em>angst</em> and fire,</p>
<p class="poemline">human heat, would roughage, sand and stone,</p>
<p class="poemline">viper, creeper, corbie circling its dregs</p>
<p class="poemline">for steaming dead flesh, wish, as we do now,</p>
<p class="poemline">frost ice the blossom, winter shelter-in-place,</p>
<p class="poemline">ground-zero cold-white glow become us?</p>
