                <p>In an era of safe spaces and trigger warnings, a kamikaze troubadour
persists as a last bastion of transgressive literature—Sean Kilpatrick.
For nearly a decade, Kilpatrick has churned out unflinching tales of
depravity. He’s earned no shortage of critics in the process, but also a
devoted cult following.</p>

<p>Kilpatrick shows no signs of slowing down. This year alone saw the
release of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1711330825/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i6" target="_blank"><strong>Shock
Test</strong></a>,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twitterfinder-General-Sean-Kilpatrick/dp/1711502642/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=sean+kilpatrick&amp;qid=1575562663&amp;sr=8-5" target="_blank"><strong>Twitterfinder
General</strong></a>,
and his latest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Goliards-Sean-Kilpatrick/dp/1710970650/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=sean+kilpatrick&amp;qid=1575562663&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank"><strong>The
Goliards</strong></a>.
All three are written as scripts, a mode that proves fitting for
Kilpatrick’s phantasmagoric wordplay, which demands to be read aloud.
The author himself describes his new book as “scripted verse in sloppily
encrypted, consecuted non-metered rhyme.” Think <em>Marat/Sade</em> written by
Sarah Kane on bad acid and you’re only halfway there.</p>

<p><em>The Goliards</em> combines painstaking research, slapstick comedy, and
outrageous violence. A gaggle of historical figures wander a European
wasteland plucked straight from a Bosch painting. They fuck, fight,
drink, and rhapsodize poetic, much like the actual
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliard" target="_blank"><em>goliards</em></a> of yore. Told in a
series of monologues, this is some of Kilpatrick’s sharpest work to
date.</p>

<p>I corresponded with Kilpatrick via email to probe the inception of his
delightfully vitriolic plays. We discuss avant-garde theatre, what it
means to copulate with language, and the perks of insanity. Check out
more of Kilpatrick’s maniacal oeuvre on his
<a href="http://anorexicchlorinesextoymuseum.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><em>blog</em></a> and purchase

<p><strong>For the uninitiated, who were the goliards? What attracted you to
exploring their ethos?</strong></p>

<p>After the manic asceticism of early Christendom, a bit before portly
affluence squandered every promise thereof, presaging how the sciences
and social niceties of our day replaced God with lamer inquisitions,
despite these belated stabs at His cultural comeback (maybe faith is
becoming rebellious again in the age of entropy, analysis spoiled rotten
by theory, because science in the last thousand years had its
ascendancy, its martyrs, its glory, and is now as corrupted by doctrine
as clergies were (and are) – art found shade in the coma of Freud and
Marx – swell for believers, but the poet is crushed by both sides of
that coin, creed and category are his nemeses, two of many reasons he
hates himself foremost: the human mind can’t avoid systems), trends of
martyrdom switched from Christ to Giordano Bruno, converting the joy of
being killed for gods and god to magic and blood under the microscope
(platitudinous concepts of wide-scale death for environmental
conservation, and a volley of jurisdictional mass shooters, bankrupted
nihilism). Simeon Stylites established the ideal, roping himself to a
pillar amongst ruins until its yarn grew as one with the flesh of his
stomach, setting maggots that fell away, gorged fat off his wound, back
to their meal with stoic acceptance (life is agony in orbit), all food
an immaterial surplus to him, Christ’s other cheek writ large with
autoerotic scar tissue (a feat unimaginable via the amenities available
most places today), and at the height of this wholesale ecstatic rapture
of death intellectualized into a condensed axiom passed around to stave
off sacrifices for harvest (our commie beard in the sky, an upstart
inkling of the individual looming brightly, one brain doing
paint-by-numbers over everything, the sole entity and creator parsed
from his cloud, dictating will to the worms in his coffin), there warred
Plato’s mystical realists (pantheism, the universe) with Aristotle’s
analytical nominalists (materialism, the atom – again, both hate poets).
The realists (not as the word is used today) said nothing’s real but the
universal, the idea is a reality distinct from the individual
constituting it: universalia sunt realia. Nominalists retorted:
universals are mere notions of the mind, individuals alone are real,
universalia sunt nomina, denying celestial abstractions. In the
mid-12th century, your nominalist, like Peter Abelard, was often a
castrated kook decried as a heretic (this has been flipped by now and
will likely flip again, fatalistically, uselessly, with better tech
available during each revolution). People of his order read the Greeks
(half in defiance of church sanctions, half to improve them), drank
their knowledge pickled at overcrowded and ultimately useless
universities (thank goodness things changed), learned vast quantities,
being autodidacts, and better yet, viciously mocked the overfed,
anti-Christian Christians who ran the orders and schools that they, the
goliards, and their kind, swiftly abandoned to go wander the big marsh
Europe was, before the word Europe (or any such prattle about uniting
nation states thronging with countless dolts) existed. Anyway, as the
literature of our time is bedraggled by the self-same etiquette catering
to a socialized clump, alongside ubiquitous ploys at academic
advancement, it seems bureaucracy is still the language necessary for
the masses, standing at their new mass of the traffic light, of the
palm-glimmer magic window, buds in their ears about how hell ain’t real,
and that we’re not in it. The latest authority relies on whichever
precept gave them power, sitting on the gains flourished thereby, using
that answer against every challenge, and is then ousted, most
deservedly, but pointlessly, as the next junta will be a temporary
solution at best. We’re perched on a series of ephemeral panaceas,
rigged alive, broken over Fortune’s wheel: <em>Carmina Burana</em>!</p>

<p><strong>Your response, and the book itself, make clear that you are as well
versed in history as you are literature. Abelard and Heloise, Simeon
Stylites, Prester John, etc. Most of your principal characters seem
based on figures from antiquity as well. How did you go about conducting
research for this project? What were your main sources?</strong></p>

<p>Severe abuse of the local library’s inter-library loan system, as a good
bum should – time made available having accomplished, with aspirational
gusto, an ignored, anathema-status from any and all potential networks –
starting with the works of the six historical characters depicted
(including Abelard’s penis), then branching into brilliantly written
studies of the era by Jane Ellen Harrison, Helen Waddell, Will Durant,
and selections from many others. I list them on
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1237847-sean?shelf=goliards"><em>goodreads</em></a>,
marking which books were preferred, or read fully and again, studied
more than others. The play I wrote on Waco blurts its sources outright,
but that might give the impression of didacticism, greatest of sins for
Americans, or imply I have any IQ. I limit my inventions to the unit,
less the ambient ideas. The words fuck, primarily. Inciting fluidity is
often a conundrum for high IQ types. High verbal IQ is about fucking
well, achieved via natural or eventual means.</p>

<p><strong>I’m curious if you would speak more about the idea of “fucking
language.” I’ve followed your work religiously since <em>Gil the
Nihilist</em> and this is an aspect of your work that has always excited me.
Despite having written reams at this point, you still find inventive
ways for language to copulate. The language fucks itself, as you noted,
but I also feel the writer and reader both participate in this fucking,
sort of akin to the wonderful orgy sequence early in <em>Goliards</em>. For me
this promiscuity permits the propagation of strange, mutated wordplay on
the page. From your perspective, what guides this linguistic fuckery?</strong></p>

<p>Others are welcome, even appreciated, at times, to join my circle jerk
of one, but their participation is not necessary. Where two words rub
together, I have directed those appendages into a growing frottage, and
hopefully the puppet ends up well-hung. I burned my life down for this
assemblage. But we are in an ascetic epoch again, eating plastic in
caves, many banished (self-banished or otherwise) to their basements.
Post-post-post-postmodernism, you don’t have to travel to find art, you
don’t need the overrated and disappearing wilderness to achieve
adventure, all that is readily available. There exists an infinite
amount of high quality work to study, at the end of a button (likewise
all sort of treasure and pussy), for better or worse (better for a
misanthrope, though the sacrifice ends bloody, because earning money is
the only hamper against winding up a homeless ghost in the street, which
is forthcoming for many a millennial, and we deserve worse). It’s okay:
they made being burned at the stake just as lame. I grew up with the Gen
X transgressive masterworks, the Enlightenment’s best and loudest dying
caw against the church, before it sloppily replaced mass with another
plugged in communal (meme’d) corniness. We were taught the meanest forms
of instinct, and to laugh at references before knowing to what they
refer, so that each layer stayed funny the more you grew and knew, and
this art all holds up, perhaps better than any generation has
experienced – the power of an influence unsurpassed. But now we’re
suffering the passive aggressive, bad girlfriend humanities, the playing
of mind games concerning one’s expectations, schizoid hire / firers
toting yuppie for-profit handbooks. Can’t be gate-kept in if you’re not
concerned with office politics and politics at large (even community
colleges), for fear you’ll alienate the fucking customers. With my doily
degrees, I hereby offer my services to any junior college, for a
whopping ten grand a year, to replace the typical, overpriced zombie
eking by on whatever cynical program was stuck in them. MFA’d
bricklayers with a headshot more worked on than their sentences, as
toothless as their agents, they are trained in the semi-literate
phenomena of relatability, a salesmanship of originality, an X-factor
affiliated beyond any hint of the biblio-onamnism that might wound
profit. Few creatives are allowed to teach anything aside from this
countertop fallacy: that quality equals readability, well-rounded
minimalism, and expository intrigue, or, failing this con, try dry
theory-jargon-gibberish meant to pick Abelard’s testicular gauze. I
exceeded my transparent pathos with prose and am old enough to have
lived through tyrannies right and left. No interest in the
uber-nominalist enigma-text that ousted the belles-lettres system.
Romanticism rejected God in favor of the artist’s innards and found we
could remain sublime, but the mechanized slaughter of the twentieth
century put the atom too high on its throne.</p>

<p><strong>While we’re on the subject of language, I’d like to dig into the
singular diction you’ve developed. Particularly in <em>Goliards</em>, much of
the word choice is archaic. For the uninitiated, this could make for a
challenging read. Take this sentence I plucked as a random example:
“Opprobriously concupiscent, commodiously flagitious, our alarum was
orgulous!” Admittedly, I had to look up every other word. Someone
fixated on concrete meaning might struggle here, but if you’re like me,
the actual meaning is secondary to the feeling evoked, or even simply
the sonic effect of the words. Is obfuscation ever a concern for you? Or
clarity be damned?</strong></p>

<p>To flex a poetics apart from our analytic lingual trap, but sloppily
aimed at becoming a constructed language closer to an agglutinative,
hyper-inflected synthetic one, euphuism post Aldous Huxley’s smug
causerie comparing genius John Lyly (the English language’s whipping boy
because he dared tamper with its simplistically crowning order) to
purple amateur Amanda McKittrick Ros (who hit floral heights by rare,
adjectival accident), then Shakespeare sneered in, like Kurosawa reduced
to George Lucas, telling Lyly to fuck himself for his trouble. A true
maximalist first incorporates minimalism into his panoply. Everyone
forgets to mention that Edward Dahlberg and Alexander Theroux are
maniacs. They only comment on how hard the reading is, and I want
revenge for having never stumbled onto those two before my dead-bodied
thirties, though I’m sure I wasn’t ready, and am not. What we have is
the humanization of gods into God. The jungle so traumatized our
ancestors that they ran right to bread for safety and, more often than
not, desire the same sponge-comfort from a book. Ritual becomes
domesticated. Now even chemistry is brought to you by the dishwasher.
People love like a chore, and the chore has been exposed as a needless,
sadistic pastime. I’m trying, impossibly, for an art that transcends
dogma to become its own dogma. It starts with a word pool of any
relevant argot, feeding on the drown-bubbles. The pruned rest is a
zygote of style cannibalized bigger (polyphonous stew). Writing can
either be the usual over-remunerated raw flow (all speed gets is
quantity) of reader connectivity that gets you blacked out in the
making, or the excessive ongoing edit that’s a jerkier (the fear of
inadvertent article repetition), but equally fulfilling, action coma.
You can’t master one approach without sacrificing the other. Ideally
both are in play simultaneously for a final draft. If anyone could be
great in lit today, and none can (lit’s not a thing), but I imagine this
person with a Bruce Lee ability to combine styles (or to bricolage
postmodernism itself as a tool that might surpass understanding, or lay
it to one side, to be deployed upon the senses willy-nilly). My word
count is merely meant to show-pony its choke, and for the goliards to
trash-compact each other in an anachronistic imitation of Middle
English, with its improvised, mealy-mouthed, usufruct war tribe origins,
and the autistic and schizophrenic nature of all language, according to
Weston La Barre. Sonic effect is meant foremost, but my bias here can
bring lines into a clarity only I, at times, often enough, perceive (the
particular line you quote above is meant to funnily cramp up in the
mouth of its nervous speaker and would be stricken if it wasn’t in the
middle of situational emphasis via hyper-monologue and following a
random rhyme scheme dictated to me by Satan). Everything I published, or
will publish, is in the process of being edited. Death’s the final STET.
My tooth worms do the talking. Even <em>Black Mirror</em> went soft. I try to
stay scary. Easy task when you have only your bowel movements left too
loose.</p>

<p><strong>To your point about staying scary, there is some fantastic Miike-level
gore in <em>Goliards</em>. The scene where the Knight eviscerates the
Highwaymen and brutalizes the pig is ecstatically bloody. What are your
thoughts on the relationship between violence and art?</strong></p>

<p>There is no difference between violence and art.</p>

<p><strong>Much of the violence in <em>Goliards</em> is pure slapstick (or maybe I just
have a sick sense of humor). Likewise, the player’s trash talk had me
laughing throughout (“Who knew manure came with prayers?”). In much of
your work, acerbic wit abounds. How do you approach balancing humor and
horror in your writing? I’ve read of your affinity for <em>Tim and
Eric</em> and <em>The Eric Andre Show</em> (perennial favs of mine as well). Who
are some of your other comic influences?</strong></p>

<p>The laughs, perhaps, are layered in, and elude me, because poets fare
better in the field of unintentional hilarity. It’s hysterical all at
once, or none of it is. I romanticize and am enamored by our modern
stretch of extreme theatres stumbling up from Punch and Judy commedia
dell’arte, through the shock of Sturm and Drang, madmen individualists
skewing their own matter like Strindberg and John Davidson (trying to be
their heir here), Maeterlinck’s static dramas, turning vile with Jarry’s
pataphysical black humor, decked out German expressionism, Grand
Guignol’s genre tinted crueler between the Schopenhauerian realities of
Henry Becque and Artaud’s metaphysical mania, Nikolai Evreinov’s theatre
for oneself, a style of troll heralding Andy Kauffman, Witkacy morphing
toward absurdism, the demented silent film slapstick of Beckett,
Ionesco’s cartoon language, and Pinter’s cringe comedies of staccato
menace (my favorite), fracturing further into Panic Movement riots, the
precise, insane whisper of Howard Barker’s Theatre of Catastrophe: The
Wrestling School, veering kitsch with the Theatre of the Ridiculous
(though the concept of kitsch would likely be aimed at me derisively,
because I mean my meanness more), the way David Lynch and Kafka have a
sublime humor far from the belly laugh, because if you started, you’d
yes yes yes yourself to death like Faulkner’s Darl Bundren, and our Gen
X to millennial versions transitioning these styles to TV, alongside
Damon Packard’s smash cut culture in overdrive, Tim and Eric’s
anti-comedy branching further into dada, punk Eric Andre (Tom Green and
<em>Jackass</em> further toward art) and leading to Sam Hyde, who brought all
this into a such refined diffusion that he can describe an episode of
<em>My So-Called Life</em> and it is the funniest, most disturbing thing
imaginable, and you cannot laugh out loud about it, for fear of having
to claw your own dick off, and apply it as makeup, to quit.</p>

<p><strong>The spirit of all those great artists you mentioned teems beneath the
surface of your work. Still, you’re not aping anyone. The voice is
wholly your own. We’ve touched on the influence of drama in your
writing. You’ve long utilized a script format. For me, the text begs to
be read aloud. There’s a performative aspect. Why do you prefer to
operate within this mode?</strong></p>

<p>I used to perform ghetto vaudeville in second grade and had designs to
do standup. Unfortunately (widening my lotto against success), the
dependencies and pathologies at play were unrelated to a need for
affirmation from crowds (disdain on the other hand…). Being something
below an online troubadour (scroll-keeping is no longer elite, and
Dahlberg sent his readers to the library, but obscure references and big
words are instantly searchable today, yet all I see are more and more
excuses not to use them – all I see are movie trailers with
mini-trailers stuck in front) allows one to accost an audience and
remain ignored. I’m a hesychast who values silence, especially in my
thirties. I began to openly decay at twenty, and, by thirty, decay was
the basis of every intermittent operation (my forties will be spent
infirmed, perhaps, and my fifties are out of the question). According to
the societal valuing that has teased me through experience after
experience: a bum musing bipolar revelations to his fleas is at least
treasured enough to be, now and again, sheltered by strangers. So the
poet’s pride favors hate relations over pity (when those relations are
live, outside a book), hence the magnitude of suicides (a way to pass
into the page, even if that circulation falters too). Though I was never
acclimated enough to work a room, or fashionable enough to be an
ultra-ironic above-it-all dandy, cunty beyond cold (to revalorize
Goethe’s astonishment with Barbey’s acerbity, at the same time, dialogue
spoken with one hundred percent belief, the 90s type of irony built in
with little concern for its volume, with no campy wink (the opposite of
McKellan and Stewart hamming up <em>Godot</em>, not a fucking play to play
crowd-catered, not a rip-roarer of a yuckfest, even when it is funny)),
or self-pleased enough to run a cult, or shark-eyed enough to pursue
power, or fool enough to support a spouse, or sane enough that any
authority will do. But this addlepated phrase ‘closet drama’ anyone
bandies about snags my prepuce. I absolutely write to be read aloud.
Preferably by Patrick Magee. If no money ventures near (none has or
will), I stake my futility against the dollar’s caprices, and have
planned which convictions I favor croaking for, which cubbyhole they’ll
scrape me out of. Regarding religion, I’m a cold customer (a Ligotti,
Mainländer type), but nothing explains for me my mystical Galway Kinnell
experience. His <em>Book of Nightmares</em> was published in the seventies. I
had never read the man. Walking outside, into a field behind the library
where I worked, I encountered his poem <em>Little-Sleep’s-Head Sprouting
Hair in the Moonlight</em>: “And you yourself / some impossible Tuesday / in
the year Two Thousand and Nine, will walk out / among the black stones /
of the field, in the rain,”) – As I read these lines, on a Tuesday, in
the year 2009, black stones were under my shoes (a big field), and it
just then began to rain. Fun coincidence, but no less proof of the power
of the word, because to touch that book feels holy to this day. So my
blasphemies and the blasphemies of my goliards are not for their own
sake (or that too, as taboo is needed), but aspects against anyone’s
sake, coasting by as we often are, especially those who lack compulsion
and become overconfident about it. Never understood anyone who isn’t a
thousand percent fixated with getting to the runniest bottom of their
trade.</p>

<p><strong><em>Goliards</em> concludes with a time-hopping epilogue. We move rapidly
from one era to the next, ending in a postmodern nightmare. Different
men state their case—a one-eyed Marlowe, a suicidal Davidson, a
baby-faced Andreyev, among others. This final scene traces the lineage
of the goliards (I think). We see what would not be possible without
their hedonistic contributions to the arts. How did you select these
descendants? Was there anyone else you thought to include that didn’t
make the cut? Do you see any contemporary artists touched by the
goliards, or has technology spoiled our craft by making everyone an
artist? I do wonder what the goliards would’ve made of Twitter.</strong></p>

<p>I belong to the order of the hypodermic hypotactic paratactic
paratrooper sawing at his own strings, senses awry since cave gas bonked
each shadow epic, Roman wine-heads high off lead poisoning, dehydrated
desert ascetics, troubadour rakes diddling farm daughters, courtier
perverts periodically banished, salon rejects hanging from a sewer
grate, and cenacle patrons at a Dinner for Schmucks (a prank described
by Evreinov in the nineteen-tens that probably existed forever). I
considered Lord Rochester, but preferred the heavier overlooked. The
Cavalier Poets I circled, and a rollcall of tributes paid to these
insane or acute portrayers of the insane: John Perceval, Witold
Gombrowicz, Stefan Grabiński, John Rodker, Lucian of Samosata, Francis
Saltus, Benjamin de Casseres, Ladislav Klíma, Géza Csáth, Charles Fort,
Alfred Chester, Sarah Kane, Luis de Góngora, Gottfried Behn, Frank
Wedekind, Georg Kaiser, James Thompson, Léon Bloy, Miguel de Unamuno,
Virgilio Piñera, Maurice Gilliams, Darius James, Maude Hutchins, Roberto
Arlt, Horacio Quiroga, Henry de Montherlant, Thomas Lovell Beddoes,
Vladimir Odoevsky, Ernest Brawley, Nina Hamnett, Fyodor Sologub, William
Sansom, Rubem Fonseca, Francis Thompson, Par Lagerkvist, Karel Capek,

Lermontov, Leigh Hunt, William Hope Hodgson, Ramón María del
Valle-Inclán, David Halliwell, Charles Stevenson Wright, Frank Walford,
Ray Bremser, George MacDonald, Joseph Hergesheimer, Robert Canzoneri,
Leslie A. Fielder, Leonard Cline, Jules Michelet, George Barker, Tom
Mallin, Jack Womack, Yasutaka Tsutsui – their tradition was never
vaunted (some a little more than others), and has now nearly petered
out.</p>

<p><strong>A recent release I’ve been recommending is Grant Maierhofer’s <em>Clog</em>.
His books continuously astound me. He’s one of a few active writers who
never fails to push literature into new boundaries. You were
Maierhofer’s editor on that project. How do you approach editing another
writer’s work? Is the process any different when revising your own
text?</strong></p>

<p>I’m bred in dada, Burroughs and other stochastic binary cutup cyberpunk
experiments, and admire the work of Kenji Siratori, so appreciate
tweaking the start of the <em>Clog</em> apparatus, but never personally
accomplished abstraction on that scale, if you see how the opening I
torqued is a bit more anchored and line focused. The Butler
collaborations were wild, but done on instinct, not process (his being
the fastest instinct in the game). The Sam Pink I never finished due to
my struggle in the other technical direction with concrete narrative. My
ex’s we left incomplete due to her and other sperm. A sci-fi novel with
a recently dead pal edited together from his ideas floats about. A Lish
consecution edit of Ben Spivey’s <em>Black God</em> got released a while back.
There’s an unproduced giallo screenplay with Jamie Grefe. Andrew
Lundwall (have to love <em>melancholia’s tremulous dreadlocks</em>, despite a
once-hot Lena Dunham being in it with us) and I started a long poem
together long ago that fell by the wayside. Collaborations are good
training for instinct and humility, and I can relate to those of a
different style because what unites us is the same thing that propelled
humanity into and through its many conundrums: obsession. With editing,
I edit others the same as I edit myself, with extreme prejudice. I’m
rarely approached to edit. Most beginners just want a polish.</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping up, what’s next for Sean Kilpatrick? You mentioned filming
some selections from <em>Goliards</em>. I fantasize about mounting a stage
production one day. Any upcoming readings or events to promote? Care to
divulge the details of new projects for our faithful readers? Bonus
question, if <em>Goliards</em> had a theme song, what would it be?</strong></p>

<p>I have obtained a ten year old camera on eBay that shoots a gorgeously
rich and sharp image, when manually manipulated to, and if the ISO is at
its lowest. I plan to, with severely limited resources, make a
dialogue-free film akin to Besson’s <em>The Last Battle</em> meets <em>Henry:
Portrait of a Serial Killer</em> (also aspiring to the <em>Texas Chainsaw</em>
dinner scene and the <em>American Werewolf in London</em> home invasion) and
then undergo the first truly millennial noir film. (Perhaps shooting
some play stuff in there, would love to see a team do one of my
tongue-tiers. I held Metallica’s <em>Leper Messiah</em> close in scope while
composing <em>Goliards</em>.) Filmmaking is nearly impossible to accomplish,
and I’m not smart, technical, or social enough to be a good director,
but I like how cinema has a universality untainted by appreciation and
is sometimes shot by shamanistic and tribal means that contradict the
industry selling them. I’ll still likely be committed to the disease of
literature, but an obsession can swap formats, especially when its
initial format has half-assedly expelled one over needless
electioneering. Audiences (hypothetical to me) need a sliver of art that
tells them to fuck themselves at everyone’s expense, even if the
practitioner of said art must spend forever gnawing off his wool to
assemble a wardrobe, the sacrifice of revealing the lowest human
faculties, proving how blood muses can exist, and anyone who denies this
has either never experienced agony, monotonous or otherwise, or has been
run down by so much pain that art is none of their business anymore,
because all they can feel is the buoyancy of their own nerve endings as
they continue to erode, which is what I care to share, with matter by
itself, if need be. Speaking of obsession (whoever doesn’t have one,
leave the arts): When I was young, I fell in love (not knowing love’s
just a control chemical) with a real Natasha Leggero prissy ice queen
rich bitch nineties dream girl with sharp taste and sharper hatred, all
fucked up, forever diddled, harboring a fair bit of self-destructiveness
and mucho wit. She had that runt princess, tiny product-of-incest bend
to her beauty: my type. To add to that, she’d lift a vintage blouse and
poke her tummy extra pale with diabetes needles, if you can imagine. I
imagine insects tried to lip her track marks in slow motion. Strong
sting of an impression and we hardly hung, a handful of months, but the
years to follow – the absurd shitty behavior of exes, the cheating
parade of one’s twenties, matter little (my heart came pre-destroyed, ha
ha, the others were playing hopscotch in her shadow, thus she helped me
cheat my hustlers, and this is why I keep painting her lovely needlework
across so many of my words – the fact that she existed is
inconsequential to me now: she’s just an homage that became art). Her
fading kind (she was my age but raised by excessively Gen X siblings)
remind me of the old cycle of a soft generation breeding a mean
generation ad infinitum (it’s the petty astrology (as Jim Goad says) of
categorization, but more fun because it’s nasty: boomers and
millennials: generally soft (hippies, save the world, safe-spaces, etc.)
and Gen X and zoomers (wiser to the game, ironic, based). At least
boomers gave us the great seventies cinema and Michael O’Donoghue. What
the fuck have millennials left behind after killing art with kindness?
Take the most ironic composure in existence: Faith No More’s “We Care a
Lot” (see their later virtuoso Mike Patton being interviewed eating a
burger, or Gen X Paul Thomas Anderson’s pizza interview: too cool to
care), an American apathy routine, not trying (passion or desperation
offends fellow scenesters), schizoid voices, mocking advertising
language, transgressive cross-dressing (back when that was taboo),
smarmy, smartass, insulting peers to sell yourself harder, not that
you’re for sale. But Gen X at their worst (“everyone’s a poseur!”) was
still miles ahead of millennials at our best. How brutally horrifying
for me: artists all sing those We Care a Lot lyrics in the most literal
and meant sense today, and no one talks about Dan Zukovic’s <em>The Last
Big Thing</em>. Millennials really aimed a cannon at the wall and climbed in
(in a way that’s far away from intentional). Sometimes circling the
drain is worse than going down it. Soon beliefs won’t be manifested,
they’ll be liked. The printing press didn’t come with a shock collar the
way the internet did. Our next major advancement will look like
sterility in lingerie and feel like a handjob from a doctor. We will be
the disposable constituents for a cause too blank to identify, and I’m
glad it’s passing me by. I’ve always been severing my tail so the knife
wags in its place.</p>
