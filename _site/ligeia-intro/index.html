  line-height: 0.9;">I</span> cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, I
	      first became acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long years have since
	      elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering. Or, perhaps, I
	      cannot now bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the character of
	      my beloved, her rare learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty, and
	      the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language, made
	      their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily progressive
	      that they have been unnoticed and unknown. Yet I believe that I met her
	      first and most frequently in some large, old, decaying city near the
	      Rhine. Of her family&mdash;I have surely heard her speak. That it is of a
	      remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia! Ligeia! in studies of a
	      nature more than all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward
	      world, it is by that sweet word alone&mdash;by Ligeia&mdash;that I bring
	      before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more. And now, while
	      I write, a recollection flashes upon me that I have never known the
	      paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed, and who became
	      the partner of my studies, and finally the wife of my bosom. Was it a
	      playful charge on the part of my Ligeia? or was it a test of my strength
	      of affection, that I should institute no inquiries upon this point? or was
	      it rather a caprice of my own&mdash;a wildly romantic offering on the
	      shrine of the most passionate devotion? I but indistinctly recall the fact
	      itself&mdash;what wonder that I have utterly forgotten the circumstances
	      which originated or attended it? And, indeed, if ever she, the wan and the
	      misty-winged Ashtophet of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell, over
	      marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over mine.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. It is
	      the person of Ligeia. In stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and, in
	      her latter days, even emaciated. I would in vain attempt to portray the
	      majesty, the quiet ease, of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible
	      lightness and elasticity of her footfall. She came and departed as a
	      shadow. I was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save
	      by the dear music of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand
	      upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. It was
	      the radiance of an opium-dream&mdash;an airy and spirit-lifting vision
	      more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered vision about the
	      slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were not of
	      that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the
	      classical labors of the heathen. &ldquo;There is no exquisite beauty,&rdquo; says
	      Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty,
	      &ldquo;without some strangeness in the proportion.&rdquo; Yet, although I saw that the
	      features of Ligeia were not of a classic regularity&mdash;although I
	      perceived that her loveliness was indeed &ldquo;exquisite,&rdquo; and felt that there
	      was much of &ldquo;strangeness&rdquo; pervading it, yet I have tried in vain to detect
	      the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of &ldquo;the strange.&rdquo; I
	      examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead&mdash;it was faultless&mdash;how
	      cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so divine!&mdash;the skin
	      rivalling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and repose, the gentle
	      prominence of the regions above the temples; and then the raven-black, the
	      glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the
	      full force of the Homeric epithet, &ldquo;hyacinthine!&rdquo; I looked at the delicate
	      outlines of the nose&mdash;and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of
	      the Hebrews had I beheld a similar perfection. There were the same
	      luxurious smoothness of surface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to
	      the aquiline, the same harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free
	      spirit. I regarded the sweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all
	      things heavenly&mdash;the magnificent turn of the short upper lip&mdash;the
	      soft, voluptuous slumber of the under&mdash;the dimples which sported, and
	      the color which spoke&mdash;the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy
	      almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon them in her
	      serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles. I
	      scrutinized the formation of the chin&mdash;and here, too, I found the
	      gentleness of breadth, the softness and the majesty, the fullness and the
	      spirituality, of the Greek&mdash;the contour which the god Apollo revealed
	      but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of the Athenian. And then I peered
	      into the large eyes of Ligeia.

	    <p>
	      For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have been,
	      too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord Verulam
	      alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger than the ordinary eyes of
	      our own race. They were even fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes
	      of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at intervals&mdash;in
	      moments of intense excitement&mdash;that this peculiarity became more than
	      slightly noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was her beauty&mdash;in
	      my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps&mdash;the beauty of beings either
	      above or apart from the earth&mdash;the beauty of the fabulous Houri of
	      the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black, and, far
	      over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows, slightly
	      irregular in outline, had the same tint. The &ldquo;strangeness,&rdquo; however, which
	      I found in the eyes, was of a nature distinct from the formation, or the
	      color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred
	      to the expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of
	      mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of the spiritual. The
	      expression of the eyes of Ligeia! How for long hours have I pondered upon
	      it! How have I, through the whole of a midsummer night, struggled to
	      fathom it! What was it&mdash;that something more profound than the well of
	      Democritus&mdash;which lay far within the pupils of my beloved? What was
	      it? I was possessed with a passion to discover. Those eyes! those large,
	      those shining, those divine orbs! they became to me twin stars of Leda,
	      and I to them devoutest of astrologers.

	    <p>
	      There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the
	      science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact&mdash;never, I
	      believe, noticed in the schools&mdash;that, in our endeavors to recall to
	      memory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very
	      verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. And
	      thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of Ligeia&rsquo;s eyes, have I felt
	      approaching the full knowledge of their expression&mdash;felt it
	      approaching&mdash;yet not quite be mine&mdash;and so at length entirely
	      depart! And (strange, oh strangest mystery of all!) I found, in the
	      commonest objects of the universe, a circle of analogies to that
	      expression. I mean to say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia&rsquo;s
	      beauty passed into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived,
	      from many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt
	      always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not the more
	      could I define that sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it. I
	      recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a rapidly-growing
	      vine&mdash;in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a
	      stream of running water. I have felt it in the ocean; in the falling of a
	      meteor. I have felt it in the glances of unusually aged people. And there
	      are one or two stars in heaven&mdash;(one especially, a star of the sixth
	      magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the large star in Lyra)
	      in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the feeling. I
	      have been filled with it by certain sounds from stringed instruments, and
	      not unfrequently by passages from books. Among innumerable other
	      instances, I well remember something in a volume of Joseph Glanvill, which
	      (perhaps merely from its quaintness&mdash;who shall say?) never failed to
	      inspire me with the sentiment;&mdash;&ldquo;And the will therein lieth, which
	      dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God
	      is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. Man
	      doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only
	      through the weakness of his feeble will.&rdquo;
	     </p>
	    <p>
	      Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to trace,
	      indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the English
	      moralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia. An intensity in
	      thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an
	      index, of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse,
	      failed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence. Of all
	      the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid
	      Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern
	      passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by the
	      miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled
	      me&mdash;by the almost magical melody, modulation, distinctness and
	      placidity of her very low voice&mdash;and by the fierce energy (rendered
	      doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance) of the wild
	      words which she habitually uttered.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense&mdash;such as I
	      have never known in woman. In the classical tongues was she deeply
	      proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the
	      modern dialects of Europe, I have never known her at fault. Indeed upon
	      any theme of the most admired, because simply the most abstruse of the
	      boasted erudition of the academy, have I ever found Ligeia at fault? How
	      singularly&mdash;how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife
	      has forced itself, at this late period only, upon my attention! I said her
	      knowledge was such as I have never known in woman&mdash;but where breathes
	      the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of moral,
	      physical, and mathematical science? I saw not then what I now clearly
	      perceive, that the acquisitions of Ligeia were gigantic, were astounding;
	      yet I was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself,
	      with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic world of
	      metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily occupied during the
	      earlier years of our marriage. With how vast a triumph&mdash;with how
	      vivid a delight&mdash;with how much of all that is ethereal in hope&mdash;did
	      I feel, as she bent over me in studies but little sought&mdash;but less
	      known&mdash;that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding before me, down
	      whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I might at length pass
	      onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden!
	    </p>
			<img src="/assets/img/ligeia_clarke4.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto my-4" alt="Second image of Ligeia" />
	    <p>
	      How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some years,
	      I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly
	      away! Without Ligeia I was but as a child groping benighted. Her presence,
	      her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the
	      transcendentalism in which we were immersed. Wanting the radiant lustre of
	      her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian lead.
	      And now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over
	      which I pored. Ligeia grew ill. The wild eyes blazed with a too&mdash;too
	      glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen hue
	      of the grave, and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank
	      impetuously with the tides of the gentle emotion. I saw that she must die&mdash;and
	      I struggled desperately in spirit with the grim Azrael. And the struggles
	      of the passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more energetic than
	      my own. There had been much in her stern nature to impress me with the
	      belief that, to her, death would have come without its terrors;&mdash;but
	      not so. Words are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of
	      resistance with which she wrestled with the Shadow. I groaned in anguish
	      at the pitiable spectacle. I would have soothed&mdash;I would have
	      reasoned; but, in the intensity of her wild desire for life,&mdash;for
	      life&mdash;but for life&mdash;solace and reason were the uttermost folly.
	      Yet not until the last instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her
	      fierce spirit, was shaken the external placidity of her demeanor. Her
	      voice grew more gentle&mdash;grew more low&mdash;yet I would not wish to
	      dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered words. My brain reeled
	      as I hearkened entranced, to a melody more than mortal&mdash;to
	      assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never before known.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have been easily
	      aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned no ordinary
	      passion. But in death only, was I fully impressed with the strength of her
	      affection. For long hours, detaining my hand, would she pour out before me
	      the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to
	      idolatry. How had I deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?&mdash;how
	      had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour
	      of her making them? But upon this subject I cannot bear to dilate. Let me
	      say only, that in Ligeia&rsquo;s more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas!
	      all unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized the
	      principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the life
	      which was now fleeing so rapidly away. It is this wild longing&mdash;it is
	      this eager vehemence of desire for life&mdash;but for life&mdash;that I
	      have no power to portray&mdash;no utterance capable of expressing.

	      At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me,
	      peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by
	      herself not many days before. I obeyed her.&mdash;They were these:

</div>

	    <p>
	      &ldquo;O God!&rdquo; half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending her arms
	      aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these lines&mdash;&ldquo;O
	      God! O Divine Father!&mdash;shall these things be undeviatingly so?&mdash;shall
	      this Conqueror be not once conquered? Are we not part and parcel in Thee?
	      Who&mdash;who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor? Man doth
	      not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the
	      weakness of his feeble will.&rdquo;
	     </p>
	    <p>
	      And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to
	      fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed her
	      last sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. I
	      bent to them my ear and distinguished, again, the concluding words of the
	      passage in Glanvill&mdash;&ldquo;Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto
	      death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.&rdquo;
	     </p>
	    <p>
	      She died;&mdash;and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no
	      longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying
	      city by the Rhine. I had no lack of what the world calls wealth. Ligeia
	      had brought me far more, very far more than ordinarily falls to the lot of
	      mortals. After a few months, therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I
	      purchased, and put in some repair, an abbey, which I shall not name, in
	      one of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair England. The
	      gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of
	      the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories connected with
	      both, had much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment which had
	      driven me into that remote and unsocial region of the country. Yet
	      although the external abbey, with its verdant decay hanging about it,
	      suffered but little alteration, I gave way, with a child-like perversity,
	      and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a display of
	      more than regal magnificence within.&mdash;For such follies, even in
	      childhood, I had imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the
	      dotage of grief. Alas, I feel how much even of incipient madness might
	      have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies, in the
	      solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture, in the
	      Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold! I had become a bounden
	      slave in the trammels of opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a
	      coloring from my dreams. But these absurdities I must not pause to detail.
	      Let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither in a moment
	      of mental alienation, I led from the altar as my bride&mdash;as the
	      successor of the unforgotten Ligeia&mdash;the fair-haired and blue-eyed
	      Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.

	    <p>
	      There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that
	      bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me. Where were the souls of
	      the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they
	      permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked, a maiden and
	      a daughter so beloved? I have said that I minutely remember the details of
	      the chamber&mdash;yet I am sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment&mdash;and
	      here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic display, to take
	      hold upon the memory. The room lay in a high turret of the castellated
	      abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size. Occupying the whole
	      southern face of the pentagon was the sole window&mdash;an immense sheet
	      of unbroken glass from Venice&mdash;a single pane, and tinted of a leaden
	      hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon, passing through it, fell
	      with a ghastly lustre on the objects within. Over the upper portion of
	      this huge window, extended the trellice-work of an aged vine, which
	      clambered up the massy walls of the turret. The ceiling, of gloomy-looking
	      oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted with the
	      wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic, semi-Druidical
	      device. From out the most central recess of this melancholy vaulting,
	      depended, by a single chain of gold with long links, a huge censer of the
	      same metal, Saracenic in pattern, and with many perforations so contrived
	      that there writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent
	      vitality, a continual succession of parti-colored fires.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in
	      various stations about&mdash;and there was the couch, too&mdash;bridal
	      couch&mdash;of an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony,
	      with a pall-like canopy above. In each of the angles of the chamber stood
	      on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the
	      kings over against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial
	      sculpture. But in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! the chief
	      phantasy of all. The lofty walls, gigantic in height&mdash;even
	      unproportionably so&mdash;were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds,
	      with a heavy and massive-looking tapestry&mdash;tapestry of a material
	      which was found alike as a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the
	      ottomans and the ebony bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous
	      volutes of the curtains which partially shaded the window. The material
	      was the richest cloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at irregular
	      intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought
	      upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black. But these figures
	      partook of the true character of the arabesque only when regarded from a
	      single point of view. By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to
	      a very remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To
	      one entering the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities;
	      but upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and step
	      by step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself
	      surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to
	      the superstition of the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the
	      monk. The phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial
	      introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the draperies&mdash;giving
	      a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In halls such as these&mdash;in a bridal chamber such as this&mdash;I
	      passed, with the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month
	      of our marriage&mdash;passed them with but little disquietude. That my
	      wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper&mdash;that she shunned me
	      and loved me but little&mdash;I could not help perceiving; but it gave me
	      rather pleasure than otherwise. I loathed her with a hatred belonging more
	      to demon than to man. My memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity of
	      regret!) to Ligeia, the beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed.
	      I revelled in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty,
	      her ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then,
	      did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her
	      own. In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was habitually fettered
	      in the shackles of the drug) I would call aloud upon her name, during the
	      silence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day,
	      as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor
	      of my longing for the departed, I could restore her to the pathway she had
	      abandoned&mdash;ah, could it be forever?&mdash;upon the earth.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the Lady
	      Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was slow.
	      The fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in her
	      perturbed state of half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in
	      and about the chamber of the turret, which I concluded had no origin save
	      in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences
	      of the chamber itself. She became at length convalescent&mdash;finally
	      well. Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second more violent disorder
	      again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame,
	      at all times feeble, never altogether recovered. Her illnesses were, after
	      this epoch, of alarming character, and of more alarming recurrence,
	      defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians.
	      With the increase of the chronic disease which had thus, apparently, taken
	      too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human means, I
	      could not fail to observe a similar increase in the nervous irritation of
	      her temperament, and in her excitability by trivial causes of fear. She
	      spoke again, and now more frequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds&mdash;of
	      the slight sounds&mdash;and of the unusual motions among the tapestries,
	      to which she had formerly alluded.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this distressing
	      subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. She had just
	      awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with feelings
	      half of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her emaciated
	      countenance. I sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans
	      of India. She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of
	      sounds which she then heard, but which I could not hear&mdash;of motions
	      which she then saw, but which I could not perceive. The wind was rushing
	      hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I wished to show her (what, let me
	      confess it, I could not all believe) that those almost inarticulate
	      breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall,
	      were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind. But a
	      deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions
	      to reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be fainting, and no
	      attendants were within call. I remembered where was deposited a decanter
	      of light wine which had been ordered by her physicians, and hastened
	      across the chamber to procure it. But, as I stepped beneath the light of
	      the censer, two circumstances of a startling nature attracted my
	      attention. I had felt that some palpable although invisible object had
	      passed lightly by my person; and I saw that there lay upon the golden
	      carpet, in the very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer, a
	      shadow&mdash;a faint, indefinite shadow of angelic aspect&mdash;such as
	      might be fancied for the shadow of a shade. But I was wild with the
	      excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these things but
	      little, nor spoke of them to Rowena. Having found the wine, I recrossed
	      the chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which I held to the lips of the
	      fainting lady. She had now partially recovered, however, and took the
	      vessel herself, while I sank upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes
	      fastened upon her person. It was then that I became distinctly aware of a
	      gentle footfall upon the carpet, and near the couch; and in a second
	      thereafter, as Rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips, I
	      saw, or may have dreamed that I saw, fall within the goblet, as if from
	      some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three or four large
	      drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid. If this I saw&mdash;not so
	      Rowena. She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and I forbore to speak to
	      her of a circumstance which must, after all, I considered, have been but
	      the suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by the
	      terror of the lady, by the opium, and by the hour.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately
	      subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the worse
	      took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the third subsequent
	      night, the hands of her menials prepared her for the tomb, and on the
	      fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber
	      which had received her as my bride.&mdash;Wild visions, opium-engendered,
	      flitted, shadow-like, before me. I gazed with unquiet eye upon the
	      sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the varying figures of the
	      drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer
	      overhead. My eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of a
	      former night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had seen
	      the faint traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no longer; and
	      breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances to the pallid and
	      rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed upon me a thousand memories of
	      Ligeia&mdash;and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent violence
	      of a flood, the whole of that unutterable wo with which I had regarded her
	      thus enshrouded. The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter
	      thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the
	      body of Rowena.

			</div>
	    <p>
	      It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I had taken
	      no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct, startled me
	      from my revery.&mdash;I felt that it came from the bed of ebony&mdash;the
	      bed of death. I listened in an agony of superstitious terror&mdash;but
	      there was no repetition of the sound. I strained my vision to detect any
	      motion in the corpse&mdash;but there was not the slightest perceptible.
	      Yet I could not have been deceived. I had heard the noise, however faint,
	      and my soul was awakened within me. I resolutely and perseveringly kept my
	      attention riveted upon the body. Many minutes elapsed before any
	      circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. At length
	      it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely noticeable
	      tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and along the sunken
	      small veins of the eyelids. Through a species of unutterable horror and
	      awe, for which the language of mortality has no sufficiently energetic
	      expression, I felt my heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid where I
	      sat. Yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my self-possession. I
	      could no longer doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations&mdash;that
	      Rowena still lived. It was necessary that some immediate exertion be made;
	      yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by
	      the servants&mdash;there were none within call&mdash;I had no means of
	      summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many minutes&mdash;and
	      this I could not venture to do. I therefore struggled alone in my
	      endeavors to call back the spirit ill hovering. In a short period it was
	      certain, however, that a relapse had taken place; the color disappeared
	      from both eyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of
	      marble; the lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly
	      expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread
	      rapidly the surface of the body; and all the usual rigorous illness
	      immediately supervened. I fell back with a shudder upon the couch from
	      which I had been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to
	      passionate waking visions of Ligeia.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second time
	      aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed. I listened&mdash;in
	      extremity of horror. The sound came again&mdash;it was a sigh. Rushing to
	      the corpse, I saw&mdash;distinctly saw&mdash;a tremor upon the lips. In a
	      minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly
	      teeth. Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which had
	      hitherto reigned there alone. I felt that my vision grew dim, that my
	      reason wandered; and it was only by a violent effort that I at length
	      succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had
	      pointed out. There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the
	      cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there was
	      even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady lived; and with redoubled
	      ardor I betook myself to the task of restoration. I chafed and bathed the
	      temples and the hands, and used every exertion which experience, and no
	      little medical reading, could suggest. But in vain. Suddenly, the color
	      fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the dead,
	      and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon itself the icy
	      chilliness, the livid hue, the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and
	      all the loathsome peculiarities of that which has been, for many days, a
	      tenant of the tomb.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia&mdash;and again, (what marvel that
	      I shudder while I write,) again there reached my ears a low sob from the
	      region of the ebony bed. But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable
	      horrors of that night? Why shall I pause to relate how, time after time,
	      until near the period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama of
	      revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only into a
	      sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore the
	      aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was
	      succeeded by I know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of
	      the corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had been
	      dead, once again stirred&mdash;and now more vigorously than hitherto,
	      although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter
	      hopelessness than any. I had long ceased to struggle or to move, and
	      remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of
	      violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible, the
	      least consuming. The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously
	      than before. The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the
	      countenance&mdash;the limbs relaxed&mdash;and, save that the eyelids were
	      yet pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the
	      grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, I might have
	      dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of Death.
	      But if this idea was not, even then, altogether adopted, I could at least
	      doubt no longer, when, arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps,
	      with closed eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream, the
	      thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle of
	      the apartment.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I trembled not&mdash;I stirred not&mdash;for a crowd of unutterable
	      fancies connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure,
	      rushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed&mdash;had chilled me
	      into stone. I stirred not&mdash;but gazed upon the apparition. There was a
	      mad disorder in my thoughts&mdash;a tumult unappeasable. Could it, indeed,
	      be the living Rowena who confronted me? Could it indeed be Rowena at all&mdash;the
	      fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, why
	      should I doubt it? The bandage lay heavily about the mouth&mdash;but then
	      might it not be the mouth of the breathing Lady of Tremaine? And the
	      cheeks&mdash;there were the roses as in her noon of life&mdash;yes, these might
	      indeed be the fair cheeks of the living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin,
	      with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?&mdash;but had she
	      then grown taller since her malady? What inexpressible madness seized me
	      with that thought? One bound, and I had reached her feet! Shrinking from
	      my touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements
	      which had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing
	      atmosphere of the chamber, huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; it
	      was blacker than the raven wings of the midnight! And now slowly opened
	      the eyes of the figure which stood before me. &ldquo;Here then, at least,&rdquo; I
	      shrieked aloud, &ldquo;can I never&mdash;can I never be mistaken&mdash;these are
	      the full, and the black, and the wild eyes&mdash;of my lost love&mdash;of
	      the lady&mdash;of the LADY LIGEIA.&rdquo;
	     </p>
