                <p>Reading David Leo Rice is akin to rolling your eyes backwards and
finding an ancient codex etched into your brain. The writing feels
unstuck from time and place, but also eerily in tune with today’s
peculiar zeitgeist. His latest release <em>Drifter</em> collects a decade’s
worth of stories. Rice’s work is impossible to classify. Straddling
somewhere between metaphysical horror and absurdist comedy, the fictions
in <em>Drifter</em> are disquieting, unnerving, and weirder than the weirdest
issue of <em>Weird Tales</em>. Naturally, I’m a huge fan.</p>

<p>In our conversation below, Rice offers insight about his creative
process. We discuss confronting the unknowable, channeling existential
dread, and the adventures of a talking chocolate bar.</p>

<p><em>Drifter</em> is available from <a href="https://1111press.com/drifter-stories" target="_blank">11:11

<p><strong>I want to start off by going way back. Can you recall the first short
story you ever wrote as a kid?</strong></p>

<p>My earliest writing memories are of collaborations with my best friend.
We wrote tons of scripts for real and imaginary movies and plays, and
some prose pieces that were probably more like fragments of an
unrealized novel. We also had a story series called something like “Tom
and the Talking Chocolate Bar.” I can’t remember what happened in it,
just a general sense of giddy adventure when we’d write together, always
longhand, with lots of crudely drawn pictures mixed in. The first “real”
story I remember writing was in ninth grade. It was a dystopian
futuristic tale called “The Veterans’ Club,” about a group of veterans
from a war that none of them could remember. When the story opened, they
were marooned in a blighted wasteland—apparently the war had been
lost, though even that was pure conjecture. Most of the story followed
their daily struggle to survive, while always feeling that there was
some larger presence they couldn’t outrun. At the very end, it becomes
clear that this presence is suicide. I remember being really proud of
the last line: “They had decided not to refill their oxygen tanks.” It’s
kind of cheesy in retrospect, but something about how, at the time, that
line seemed to fulfill the latent promise of the whole story came as a
revelation, and sparked a quickening mood in me, while writing it, that
I still try to cultivate today.</p>

<p><strong>You should totally write an updated version of “Tom and the Talking
Chocolate Bar” and send it to <em>Ligeia</em>!</strong></p>

<p>It could be a sinister tale where it turns out that the chocolate bar
has been talking, on and on, ignored for years, until an adult writer
named Tom stumbles upon it and has to respond to whatever it’s been
saying. Perhaps, as a means of grounding its own unwanted consciousness
in an origin story, the chocolate bar compels him to back-project
memories of having conjured this story as a child, so that all of his
memories of having dreamed of being a writer when he was young become
contorted through that narrative. Perhaps his sole artistic
achievement—so he thinks—is to build a narrative framework around
the otherwise inexplicable presence of this talking chocolate bar,
claiming it as a product of his youthful imagination even if the truth
is much darker. I’ll definitely write that story.</p>

<p><strong>I can see a story like “The Veterans’ Club” planting seeds for the
terrain you cover in your mature work—dystopian futures, blighted
landscapes, distorted memories.</strong> <strong>The stories in <em>Drifter</em> span a
whole decade’s worth of material. I remember first stumbling across one
of your pieces in <em>Black Clock</em> back in 2012. How was the experience of
revisiting work from the distant past? Do you see an evolution or
progression in terms of your writing?</strong></p>

<p>In general, the experience of revisiting older work is like that of the
hypothetical Tom: I’m always trying to hear what the older (or younger,
depending on how one sees time—the work seems old, but the self seems
young) version of me was straining to express, and if there’s any way
that I can apply what I’ve learned about myself, and about writing, in
the intervening years to better bring out what’s in an older story,
without changing it to reflect my current worldview. This is a tricky
balance, I found, because I did want to polish every story here in as
“contemporary” a way as I could, so that the collection as a whole would
read like the product of my 2020/2021 self, but at the same time I
wanted to preserve the essence of the stories, which, as you mentioned,
date back to 2012 and even before. I hope the collection, when read as a
whole, will serve as a record of the changing mental states during this
very bizarre decade, both my own mental states and perhaps everyone
else’s, as well. Looking back on the 2010s, I feel lucky to have come of
age as a writer during years of tremendous flux in the real and
narrative worlds we share, and I think my approach to the weird, the
horrific, and the uncanny has evolved, by necessity, as the decade wore
on.</p>

<p>In a more technical sense, one major trend in my work over that decade
has been to continually refine my relation to the ineffable and the
unspeakable. I want my stories to hint at realms of reality beyond what
can be known, but, at the same time, I want them to be vivid rather than
vague, and tangible rather than overly fluid. Maybe this is a way of
saying that I’ve fought an internal battle between accessibility and
inaccessibility, trying to get the right balance between concrete
external expression, and numinous internal mystification.</p>

<p>This battle has been the most exhilarating—and sometimes
maddening—aspect of the process behind all these stories, each of
which appeared at a different point along the way. And I think it also
relates to larger trends in the decade in question, with the sense that
somehow reality was getting away from us, collapsing into an infinite
array of pseudo-realities, while, at the same time, the feeling that
genuinely significant changes were going on kept intensifying. I
therefore hope these stories succeed in conveying the sense that
<em>something major</em> is afoot, but we can never say for sure what it is
(and anything we do say might, by default, be a distraction).</p>

<p><strong>For me the stories in <em>Drifter</em> definitely capture the zeitgeist of
the past decade. Crumbling landscapes, infectious paranoia, hostile
mobs, inexplicable transformations, people being manipulated by forces
beyond their comprehension. The ever present unknowable, as you
mentioned, seems to be what your writing hinges on. I do think you
strike the right balance between ambiguity and explicitness. Even at
their most surreal, another unsettling aspect of these stories is how
they still feel eerily plausible, like they could be playing out in some
forgotten corner of the country as we speak. What’s your approach to
keeping a story grounded when venturing into far out terrain?</strong></p>

<p>The stories in <em>Drifter</em> grew out of this unremitting feeling that
something unknowable is almost within reach, but it can never quite be
known, nor can our sense of its presence be suppressed to the point
where it no longer calls out to us. It’s like Mitch Hedberg’s joke
about how maybe all the photos of Bigfoot are blurry because Bigfoot
himself is blurry—the sense that we’re confronting something
intrinsically blurry resonates with the condition of the new millennium,
where we never get any resolution either way: we never lose the
perception that <em>something</em> bizarre is afoot, nor do we ever find out
(in a way that feels durable and legitimate) exactly what it is… which
must be why so many lurid and conflicting explanations keep cropping up.</p>

<p><em>Drifter</em> evolved along with this condition as an attempt to embrace and
even celebrate its ambiguity, and to find pathos and excitement in the
state of sensing (it’s hard not to overuse this word) that something
beyond the knowable is true, and is potentially happening nearby, in
another town or part of the country, as you put it. Another aspect of
this feeling, for me, is an internal ambivalence between, on the one
hand, <em>hoping</em> that something wild and life-changing is about to break
through, while, on the other hand, hoping that a semblance of
predictability and security will prevail. The whole Covid saga has
exemplified this conundrum, in that people seemed torn between a giddy
excitement at the prospect of radical change and an understandable but
in some ways atavistic desire to just “go back to normal” at any cost.
Maybe my effort to hone my writing practice is a means of embracing
rather than resisting this ambiguity: I’ve felt that if the stories
themselves were sufficiently concrete, I could accept that my desire for
concreteness in the outside world would never be satisfied, and that in
some ways this might be a positive adaptation for the world we’re surely
still heading into.</p>

<p>From a narrative point of view, I always try to ground the stories by
starting with an intimation that grows out of a real time and place. I
travel as much as possible and try to marinate in a wide variety of
atmospheres, never directly looking for stories, but rather letting them
emerge, almost like a natural resource. I approach the world with the
conviction that all places are haunted in their own way, so if you just
sync up to these hauntings, and let them speak to you, the stories
almost write themselves. In this way, I hope, a core of reality refracts
through the more fantastical and symbolic aspects of the fiction,
helping it express in a more overt form what’s already latent in our
everyday world.</p>

<p><strong>I was consistently amazed by the striking originality of your stories.
A housesitter plagued by a giant tongue, a boy swimming through jello
into a new dimension, an old man volunteering to ride a euthanasia
rollercoaster. Even you just riffing off the cuff about a talking
chocolate bar is compelling! I like what you said about letting a story
organically emerge rather than consciously searching for one. Where does
that initial spark for a story come from? An image? An experience? A
line? Or do you just wake up one day and decide, “I’m going to write a
story about the Brothers Squimbop!”</strong></p>

<p>I’m not sure if this is a particular literary theory or just a general
piece of wisdom from the ages, but I’ve always loved the idea that every
good story has some combination of literal observation and metaphorical
twist—it’s the synthesis of these two modes that gives rise to the
story and lets it take shape as a piece that’s distinct from the larger
flux of thought and imagination. My process with novels vs. short
stories is different, because I think of the novels as environments that
I’m slowly exploring and building out, whereas the stories I tend to
envision more or less completely before I start working (even if they
change along the way). But the central idea of conception occurring when
an observation collides with a burst of imagination holds true in both
cases. The notion of sudden inspiration may be true in a perceptual
sense, in that I do often have the experience of a story seeming to
emerge out of nowhere, but the reality, I suspect, is more that a new
idea is making contact with a seedbed of older ideas, and finally
activating them to the point where they can cohere into a story, rather
than languishing as disconnected inklings without a central metaphor.</p>

<p>Speaking of seedbeds, I’ve always been drawn to the idea of seediness,
both as a type of real environment and as an aesthetic mode to work in.
A seedy place or scenario feels <em>almost</em> pregnant, in the sense that
these potent seeds are lying around, but they haven’t quite taken root
yet, for whatever reason. My approach to writing is thus to first notice
the seeds through observation, and then induce conception through some
imaginative intervention—whatever spark had been missing. Then, once
this pregnancy has begun, the story develops in what feels like a
natural way. Its final form is already latent within it, so the effort
of writing feels more exploratory than generative, though this may be
another metaphor to describe something that’s otherwise too abstract to
pinpoint. One way or another, my goal with any given piece is to become
increasingly passive, in the sense that, as it develops, I want to feel
more and more like I’m feeding something that’s determined to become
whatever it’s going to be, rather than actively deciding what that is.</p>

<p>Another huge source of observed inspiration is dreams, which for me
function in the same way: they yield seedy images, personages, and
situations, but then the waking labor is to find a way to incorporate
these into a form that somebody else can sync up with and enjoy, which
often requires exploding them and trying to consider more lucidly what’s
inside, since in a dream these essences are obvious, while in waking
life, they never quite are. This process fails if the reader feels like
they’re just experiencing <em>my</em> dream (everyone knows how boring it is to
hear someone else tell you about their dreams), while it succeeds if the
reader feels like the story is inducing their own dream. This is a line
that I’m always aware of, because I believe that dreaming consciousness
can be experienced while awake, but the means of accessing it are very
different than when we’re asleep. It comes for free at night, but during
the day it has to be earned. This is the active part of the writing
process, before the more passive part can begin.</p>

<p><strong>I’m glad you touched on the dreamlike quality permeating <em>Drifter</em>.
The word “induce” is apt because I often felt strange shifts in my own
consciousness while reading the book. Often it was akin to a waking
nightmare, like sleep paralysis. Or a really fucked up fairy tale. I
found more often than not the stories were seriously unsettling. “The
Hate Room” and “Circus Sickness” in particular got under my skin.
There’s a potent sense of existential dread throughout the collection,
punctuated with supernatural/cosmic horror undertones. What’s something
that scares you in real life and how do those fears bleed into your
work?</strong></p>

<p>Great to hear it got under your skin, though sorry for any unwelcome
effects that may have had! I definitely think of horror as an ingredient
in whatever I’m working on. For me, horror is a means of coming
face-to-face with the real, in the sense that horror, like humor, is an
effect that can’t be faked—if something scares you, or makes you
laugh, it’s a genuine response because it involves a recognition that
something true, often uncomfortably so, is being articulated. It reaches
us beneath whatever we’d like to think, or like to be seen as thinking,
and thus might be considered a dubious or primitive effect, but it
derives tremendous power from the access it has to these base parts of
us. Like sexual arousal, fear is involuntary, working on a level that
our conscious minds can’t control.</p>

<p>This notion of tunneling under the conscious mind to touch on whatever
lies beneath is part of how I try to subvert my own thought processes
while writing, in order to attempt to make contact with a realm of
cosmic horror that I “know but don’t know,” in the sense that it’s
always there, but I can’t always say what it is. Cosmic horror is a key
component of what I hope to get out of fiction, because it involves
uncovering unwelcome facts about the basic nature of existence, facts
that perhaps all of human culture and even consciousness itself function
in order to cover up (and that we thus can never knowingly pinpoint). If
circumstantial horror involves something going wrong within an otherwise
stable system—a slasher stalking a summer camp, for example—then
cosmic or existential horror involves something going right—the
universe revealing its perfect, hidden nature, which may have nothing at
all to do with what we, as humans, would like to imagine it is. For me,
this zone is far scarier and more creatively compelling.</p>

<p>I was discussing the stories in this collection with my father recently
when he said, “None of these characters quite have what it takes to be
alive, but their saving grace is that they sort of know this.” That
struck me, and resonates with your question about what scares me in real
life, and how it bleeds into my work: what scares me is the fear that
the life we’re living, if we’re even the slightest bit content with it,
is a sham covering some much bleaker truth, which we can sort of
perceive but don’t want to look at. All of my work is marked by an
ambivalence about whether, if we can sense this possibility, we ought to
stare right at it—the climaxes of many of these stories involve, as my
father pointed out, characters coming briefly into contact with a dark
truth they can witness but never change—or if looking away as long as
possible is actually the nobler path. When I was younger, I would have
insisted that staring down this truth is the essence of courage, but now
I’m not so sure. Maybe trying to be happy despite its presence is where
true courage lies.</p>

<p>In my daily life, I value comfort, coziness, and routine. I’m a total
creature of habit, and I love to feel safe and secure wherever I am.
Nevertheless, I’m always aware, either dimly or vividly, that something
else may be going on underneath, eating away at the foundations of my
contentment, and therefore defining that contentment as a defense
mechanism against the unspeakable. As a focal point for these fears,
books mediate both aspects. On the one hand, they’re a source of great
comfort: I associate books with fresh coffee, morning sunlight, and a
comfy chair, while, at the same time, the most harrowing depths of
horror, degradation, and ferocity that I’ve ever plumbed have also been
accessed through books. This duality is what I’m always trying to touch
on when I write, hoping to feed back into my own unresolved sense about
the nature of books by producing more of them.</p>

<p>In a much broader sense, I feel this ambivalence about all of art,
because it’s a fundamental component of what we call culture, even as it
yearns to express the possibility that culture is no more than a
society-wide attempt to hide from ourselves the burden of horrifying
knowledge—of death, of nonbeing, of the vastness of the universe and
our tininess within it—that we are all condemned to carry. Maybe
denial vs. acceptance is one of the key themes that I’ll explore
throughout my life.</p>

<p><strong>Your point about the dichotomy of books being a source of comfort and
unease is spot on. I think <em>Drifter</em> captures that juxtaposition. A lot
of the stories exist in the uncanny valley. There’s something familiar
but it’s twisted in a way that catches you off guard. The apocalyptic
superstore in “ULTRA MAX.” Tourists idling beside an impossibly huge
beached whale in “Out on the Coast.” A plague of suburban suicides in
“Sandman Crescent.” Reading these stories, I kept thinking, “This is
what America is going to be like in the future.” Your work reflects much
of the decay in our society. Do you feel like you’re writing in the face
of a dying empire? How can art help us navigate these strange times we
live in?</strong></p>

<p>That uncanniness about books as a response to the world is always on my
mind: the uncertainty about whether channeling an all-pervasive sense of
unease and impending doom into fiction is a means of engaging with those
forces, or of pushing them away. I remember as a teenager having the
thought that writing was the only means I could imagine of making myself
a “moving target,” in the sense of developing an active, dynamic back
and forth with my impressions of the world, rather than just letting
them slam into me and grind me down. I did karate a lot during those
years, and there we learned that you should never be too rigid or too
limp, but rather always fluid and adaptable to the situation around you,
while maintaining an inner commitment to balance: that ethos probably
informed my sense of how fiction can channel and respond to the world as
much as anything else did.</p>

<p>In terms of whether we’re living in a dying empire, that’s another
lingering question from this past decade. Last year I started an essay
series called “Unworkable Equilibrium,” which tries to interrogate the
seemingly paradoxical state in which—in America, anyway—we’re
surrounded by an atmosphere of impending collapse, even as the
relatively safe, consumerist lifestyles of many millions of people
continue uninterrupted (so much so that the narrative of collapse is
itself sold back to us as another consumer option). This relates back to
the question of fiction’s place in the world, insofar as there’s a
growing disjunct between what we might call “narrative” and what we
might call “reality,” to the point where it grows almost impossible to
say which is which, and to track how and where they diverge. Perhaps,
then, sources that call themselves “fiction” have a unique opportunity
to tell truths that other sources, claiming to tell the truth, no longer
can.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel agnostic: it seems certain that America as a dominant
world empire is in decline, but whether a definitive crash will come in
the next few years or the next few centuries is still hard to say. On
the planetary level, I’ve always been interested in apocalypticism as a
cultural force, which, so far, manifests as disappointed apocalypticism,
in the sense that many cultures, throughout history, have predicted the
end of the world without its yet arriving. There’s something innately
human about yearning for our own deaths to coincide with the death of
everything, and a sense of deep FOMO in the fear that the world will go
on without us. Also, apocalypticism is a grandiose manifestation of the
desire for the supernatural to emerge from the banal: to see the signs
of decay and decadence around us come together into a spectacular
finale, rather than just wearing down and down and down. It’s a search
for redemption in that regard.</p>

<p>As we live on in this interim, maybe all we can do is embrace what’s
around us, even while knowing that it’s both degraded in quality and
finite in duration. In stories like “ULTRA MAX” and “Out on the Coast,”
the characters are immersed in signs of collapse—a dead landscape
populated only by superstores, or the corpse of an impossibly large
whale—and yet the inner drama for these characters involves dredging
up the ability to love those things, and to witness them as beautiful
and fulfilling, despite the awareness of how gruesome they are in the
present, and how bad an omen they are for the future. That might be the
best summation of where my thinking stands, in terms of what lies ahead:
by many metrics, things don’t look good, and yet the only viable
response I can see is to celebrate what’s still here, seeking to find
whatever remains spiritualized within it. My hope is that this—as a
means of seeing the world, and hence also of generating fiction to feed
back into it—is a workable middle path between denial and despair.</p>

<p><strong>As a writer who’s been in the game for a while now, what advice might
you offer to someone trying to break into publishing? What do you wish
David Leo Rice had known ten years ago that you know now?</strong></p>

<p>I remember reading an interview with Rudy Wurlitzer where he said, “All
a writer can do is pray for patience.” I like the idea that patience
might be something external to you, a power you can pray to be granted
but can’t generate on your own. That rings true. If I think now of my
own advice, as I look back on this decade, two ideas come to mind. The
first is to probe your own insecurities and ambivalences, trying to find
something genuinely unresolved in yourself that may also expand into a
deeper irresolution in the time and place you live in, since this will
connect you to your readers. If art is always about accessing the
universal through the specific, then the best way for a writer to access
the universal is to drill into the specifics of their own uncertainties,
fears, and doubts about the world they inhabit, striving to see
themselves as both a unique consciousness and also, in profound and
disturbing ways, a generalized example of consciousness itself—this is
the ground that, if anyone wants my advice, I’d say is most worth
exploring.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think it’s crucial to ask yourself what’s good and powerful
in your work, as it develops. In my experience, aspiring writers are
often really hard on their actual work, while nurturing a kind of
overarching dream of <em>themselves</em> as good and exalted in a hypothetical
future. This is the dream of being a writer, rather than the tangible
process of writing a book. There’s nothing wrong with this dream per se,
but the only way to approach it in reality is to locate that sense of
excitement and pride in the pages you produce. When I edit a draft of a
project, I’m certainly hard on it, crossing out many lines and making
notes about what needs to improve, but I also look carefully for which
passages do manifest my ideas about what my writing should be, and put
big check marks or smiley faces next to these parts, so I can, over the
years, train myself to generate <em>more of this, and less of everything
else.</em> Here too, the key is modulating between the general (I want to be
a writer) and the specific (this paragraph is good, even if the next
three aren’t).</p>

<p>If I could speak across time to my younger self, I’d tell him all of
this, and also, most importantly, I’d tell him to just keep going, to do
the work rather than not doing it. That’s the only solid ground I know
of, and you can’t persevere along this path if you don’t keep both feet
solidly upon it.</p>
