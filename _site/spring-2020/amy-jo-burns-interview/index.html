                <p>Amy Jo Burns is the author of the memoir <em>Cinderland</em> (2014), in which
she reflects upon the abuse she and other young girls faced at the hands
of a well-liked piano teacher in the Rust Belt town of Mercury,
Pennsylvania. Her writing has appeared in <em>The Paris Review Daily</em>, <em>Tin
House</em>, <em>Ploughshares</em>, <em>Gay Magazine</em>, <em>Electric Literature</em>, <em>Literary Hub</em>,
and the anthology <em>Not That Bad.</em></p>

<p>In her debut novel, <a href="http://amyjoburns.com/" target="_blank"><em>Shiner</em></a>—forthcoming from Riverhead Books on May
12, 2020—Burns tells the story of Wren Bird, a preacher’s daughter who
has been cloistered away in a secluded Appalachian world of snakes,
miracles, and powerful men<em>.</em> When a miracle performed by her father
turns to tragedy, Wren must face her parents’ harrowing histories in
order to move forward into her own future. A magical must-read, <em>Shiner</em>
is a novel imbued with all the wonder and secrets of the lush West
Virginia mountains.</p>

<p>Full of enthusiasm and wit, Burns is always a delight to talk to. We
chatted over email, discussing the transition from memoir to novel, the
risks of writing, and her upcoming novel, <em>Shiner</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Your first book, a beautiful and haunting memoir called <em>Cinderland</em>,
came out with Beacon Press back in 2014. Since it is a book that faces
personal trauma and small-town isolation head-on, I assume there was
some trepidation on your part when that release date came around. What
was your post-<em>Cinderland</em> experience like, both writing-wise and
otherwise?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve never been so scared as I was when <em>Cinderland</em> was published. I
was really afraid of what my hometown would think when they found out
I’d written about something we’d all silently agreed to never speak
of—which was one of many reasons I wrote the book. I wanted to
understand why that fear had taken such a complete hold of me. The
reactions from people who knew me when I was young were very mixed. It
took me a while to see that this was ultimately a good thing. A close
friend and mentor of mine told me that if everyone had liked the book,
then it meant I hadn’t told the truth. The scandal that happened in my
hometown was so complicated, and I don’t think anyone really got the
chance to properly grieve because of all the silence surrounding it.</p>

<p>It’s possible that publishing <em>Cinderland</em> cost me the good opinion of
a select few who used to know me, but the support I received was
overwhelming. I regained old friendships I thought I’d lost. The
mothers of my high school friends as well as my teachers reached out to
tell me how proud they were. But even with all the love, I felt
extremely exposed when the book came out. I’d laid bare my biggest
shame. That’s not a complaint—I certainly signed up for it! But I
felt a deep exhaustion that I didn’t know how to treat. I was also
really sick of myself.</p>

<p>When I tried to write during that time period, I was longing for new
material. Something that felt like uncharted territory. I was so
surprised to find myself drawn to moonshiners—artisans who perfect
their craft in the middle of the night because it isn’t safe (or legal)
to do in daylight. I related to how misunderstood they must feel, and
yet how resilient they are to continue doing what they love, regardless
of what people may say. And that’s (in part) where the seeds of
<em>Shiner</em> first took root.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of <em>Shiner</em>, when did you decide that a novel was your next
move? How did you begin that new writing process?</strong></p>

<p>Actually, it was <em>Cinderland</em> that caught me off guard! I’d always
dreamed of being a novelist, but every time I sat down to write, it was
clear that I was circling this thing that had happened to me that I was
afraid to talk about. I realized if I didn’t write my way through those
memories, then I’d always be writing around them. I wrote a few short
essays and used them to apply to a nonfiction MFA program. When I got a
phone call to let me know I’d been accepted, I was so shocked that I
couldn’t even manage to say anything in response!</p>

<p>I spent the next two years learning how to write a memoir, and then the
following two years after that actually writing it. I will always be so
grateful I wrote a memoir first. It gave me a really strong foundation
and a sense of identity as an artist and as a human. When I sit down at
my desk now to work on something new, I say to myself, “You’ve already
written a really hard thing. You can totally do it again.”</p>

<p><strong>I definitely understand the feeling of writing that one thing that
both scares you and gnaws at you to be said. You’ve previously touched
on this idea in your essay for LitHub called “The Risk, and Reward, of
Turning from Memoir to Fiction.” In the essay, you write, “Sometimes
writing fiction feels like getting away from something, and writing
memoir feels like getting caught. Sometimes the opposite is true.” Could
you speak more on the risks of writing? What are the risks we run as
writers, even when the stories aren’t our own?</strong></p>

<p>Risk is something I think about a lot. Most of the time when something
I’m writing isn’t working, it’s because I haven’t put myself at
enough risk. Or to put it another way, I haven’t clearly defined the
stakes for myself. I think a writer has to do that first before she can
do it for her characters (imagined or real). The stakes for me usually
have to do with something I’m afraid to acknowledge. I’ve found that
my best writing always lies down the path of revealing some truth I
never wanted to know, but I do.</p>

<p>I also have bottom line for myself in terms of essay and memoir. No
matter what I’m writing about, I need to be the one who is the most
exposed—or, to put it in terms of your question, I need to be the one
taking the biggest risk. It’s easy to dissect someone else’s
shortcomings. It’s much harder (and much more rewarding) to dissect
your own. When we do this with even a small amount of courage, I think
our readers become very good judges of who to hold accountable. They
don’t need our help to do it. And just from a personal perspective,
this practice has also helped me forgive myself for a lot of things.</p>

<p>I feel like I might be painting the idea of “risk” as this scary
monster, but I don’t mean to! The most exciting kind of risk we take as
writers is when we fall in love with what we’re working on. That
feeling is why I keep at it every day.</p>

<p><strong>To steer away from risk and hard truths and back towards your
books—you are exceptional at breathing life into the settings that you
write about. One might say that your settings become characters in their
own right. In <em>Shiner,</em> the cloistered Appalachian mountainside the Bird
family lives on intrinsically affects the characters’ livelihoods and
emotional wellbeing. In <em>Cinderland</em>, though the quintessential American
town is an archetype at this point, your attention to detail makes
Mercury into something living and breathing on the page, even for those
of us who have never set foot there. How do you achieve this level of
intimacy? What is your research process like, and how much do you pull
from memory?</strong></p>

<p>I always start with memory. The past often feels more alive to me than
the present. Memories just come organically with an instant mood, you
know? So first I try to capture that mood, what it felt like to be in a
certain place at a certain time. I follow where my intuition leads, and
I’ll make themed playlists to listen to while I work. This is when I
like to write by hand. Usually once I’ve taken it as far as I can on my
own, I’ll start doing a deep dive into books, documentaries,
interviews, court documents, and photos from the time and place I’m
writing about. I use these to square up my memories as well as add some
telling details.</p>

<p>It’s hard for me to keep writing while I’m doing this kind of
information gathering, so I tend to wait very impatiently until I’ve
done enough research to make it feel like I’m breathing the same air as
my characters. Basically I want the world I’m writing to feel more real
than the world I’m living in—that’s how I know I’m ready to head
back into the manuscript and start the work of deepening it.</p>

<div class="u-release my-5">

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p class="h2">&#8220;No one was talking about consent like they are now, even though these kinds of crimes are nothing new.&#8221;</p>
    </blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<p><strong>In both <em>Cinderland</em> and <em>Shiner</em>, there are strong themes of female
solidarity. In <em>Cinderland,</em> you talk about the shame you continue to
feel for remaining silent rather than defending the other young girls
who spoke out about their abuse. In <em>Shiner’s</em> anachronistic mountain
community, women must stick together in hopes of survival and escape, so
they pass on their stories matrilineally to save their daughters. In
this era of fourth-wave feminism and #MeToo, you certainly aren’t alone
in tackling these issues—I’m thinking of Sophia Shalmiyev’s <em>Mother
Winter</em>, T Kira Madden’s <em>Long Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls</em>,
Jeannie Vanasco’s <em>Things We Didn’t Talk About When I Was a Girl</em>, etc.
With nearly six increasingly fraught years between your two books, can
you reflect on how this changing atmosphere has affected your writing
process, your themes, how your work has been perceived, etc.?</strong></p>

<p>I think the biggest difference that came out of those six years is the
emerging lexicon of the #MeToo movement. It gives me so much hope. The
term “sexual assault” wasn’t very widely used back when <em>Cinderland</em>
came out, and now that it’s part of the conversation we’re having
about these issues, I think there’s a larger understanding that the
term deserves a broad definition—just like the word “rape” does,
which Jeannie Vanasco covers so incredibly well in her memoir. No one
was talking about consent like they are now, even though these kinds of
crimes are nothing new. Women have always understood each other on these
matters, and I think publishers are slowly starting to give us our
rightful platform.</p>

<p>I’ve watched stories just like mine play out over and over in the
media. It’s not the stories that have changed, so my writing process
and my work itself remains the same as it always has. I think what’s
changing is that people are finally gathering the courage to listen.</p>

<p><strong>And what role do you think fiction specifically plays in these
critical and courageous times?</strong></p>

<p>I think fiction writers have an incredibly powerful opportunity to
distill the experiences of many into the experience of a single
character. Fiction is our opportunity to say: this is the art I want to
see in the world, this is the elixir I made that might help heal us.</p>

<p><strong>What are you currently reading?</strong></p>

<p>My favorite subject! I recently loved <em>Such a Fun Age</em> by Kiley Reid and
<em>Take Me Apart</em> by Sara Sligar. They’re both page-turners that also
address wealth, sexism, racism, and mental illness. Next up for me are a
few books I’ve been dying to read: <em>Writers &amp; Lovers</em> by Lily King, <em>So
We Can Glow</em> by Leesa Cross-Smith, and <em>Recipe for a Perfect Wife</em> by
Karma Brown.</p>

<p>Have you been reading anything good lately?</p>

<p><strong>I have! My to-be-read pile is miles long at this point, what with all
of the highly anticipated titles hitting the shelves left and right. I
recently breezed through <em>Shiner</em>, of course, and I’m looking forward
to seeing it in my local bookstores. As of right now, I’m reading <em>The
Magical Language of Others</em> by E.J. Koh and <em>Shock Treatment</em> by Karen
Finley. I figured that the latter would be a pertinent read in these
trying times because of its dealings with illness and how it intersects
with politics, politicized identities, and vulnerable populations. To
borrow the words of Amy Scholder from her “Note from the Editor” in
the 25th Anniversary Edition of <em>Shock Treatment</em>: “In these texts
[Finley] was able to put into language what it felt like to live and
die in those plague years, when the brutality of deadly disease was
surpassed only by the fearsome culture of cruelty surrounding the most
vulnerable communities.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Next up for me is Su Hwang’s newest poetry collection, <em>Bodega</em>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And now for the final, inevitable question … Besides diving into a
whole host of exciting new releases, what’s next for you?</strong></p>

<p>Right now my biggest project is homeschooling my two small children,
since we’re housebound for the foreseeable future until the virus stops
its spread. I will admit to you—it’s daunting! Other than that, I’m
slowly working on another novel (which feels so wonderful to share).
It’s about a meteor that strikes the same small town where a famous
female folksinger once disappeared, and how her past starts to
intertwine with the young woman who witnesses the meteor strike the
ground. It’s still <em>very</em> much in progress, but so far, I’m enjoying
the journey.</p>
