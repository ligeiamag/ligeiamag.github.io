                <p><em>House of Cotton</em>, the debut novel of Monica Brashears, follows Magnolia
Brown, a woman who—after the death of her grandmother—takes a job
from a stranger to work in his funeral parlor. There, she is tasked with
impersonating the deceased for those who seek a living reconnection. As Magnolia
assumes the roles of the dead, her grandmother’s apparition appears,
imploring her to reflect on a previous trauma.</p>

<p>The strength of <em>House of Cotton</em> is its protagonist. Brashears animates Magnolia through her distinct voice—brash, sometimes angry,
sometimes playful, her mind a contrast to the powerlessness she feels in
the external world. Through her, <em>House of Cotton</em> comments on race,
gender, power. We relate to Magnolia through her dreams, fairytales
in which she often flattens into an object, a secondary figure subsumed
in the primary:</p>

<p>“I am straw. I am sunbaked straw in Germany, locked in a quiet room … A
pretty woman in a deep blue velvet dress sobs. She say to the little
man: <em>You can’t have my first born</em>. … The pain got to make me brand
new. I am shining. I am a heap of gold. I don’t feel nothing but the
glimmer.”</p>

<p>Monica contributed <a href="https://www.ligeiamagazine.com/spring-2020/3-stories-monica-brashears/" target="_blank">3
Stories</a>
to LIGEIA almost three years ago, and I knew then she was one
to watch. <em>House of Cotton</em> is a surprising, unconventional novel, and I
was happy to talk with Monica about her influences, process, and future.</p>

<p><em>House of Cotton</em> is available via <a href="https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/house-of-cotton/" target="_blank">Flatiron Books</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The protagonist, Magnolia, takes an unusual job working for a strange
duo, Cotton and Eden—body nostalgists at a funeral home. How did you
develop the character of Magnolia and the concept of Magnolia
impersonating the dead for grieving families?</strong></p>

<p>The idea for <em>House of Cotton</em> began as a short story for an
undergraduate fiction workshop at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville. I hadn’t found my voice, and I didn’t know how to revise, so
I shelved it. Once in the MFA program at Syracuse, Magnolia’s voice
returned in a piece of flash fiction with a blue flamed urgency. I think
the development would not have been possible without the years between
the short story and the first draft of the novel. Discovery (in both
craft and what exactly I wanted to say) was necessary before sitting in
that expansive-book-length space.</p>

<p><strong>The novel’s tone is in the Southern Gothic tradition, sometimes at the
corner of noir. Near their early meeting, Magnolia describes Eden like
this: “Her smile got a pout to it. She keeps rubbing my wrist like she
got all the answers in her touch. Pity in her green eyes, a stagnant
lake with algae and duck shit.” Can you speak to the role of this tone
in <em>House of Cotton</em>, especially with dark fairytale elements? Were
there any particular authors or works in the genre that influenced this
one?</strong></p>

<p>Yes! The writing I was first introduced to was Stephen King, fairytales,
and Bible stories (scary, scary southern Baptist delivery)—all of
these having a dark underbelly that will always be present in my
writing. Later, I fell in love with Toni Morrison &amp; Gayl Jones &amp; Jesmyn
Ward &amp; Gloria Naylor &amp; Carmen Maria Machado—writers who work with
similar dark tones that align more closely with my lived experience and
interests on the page.</p>

<p><strong>In the novel, the living and dead seem to exist in a state of
co-dependence. Can you discuss the significance of this intersection in
the world of your story?</strong></p>

<p>Yes! I haven’t heard the relationships framed as co-dependent before,
but there’s something there that hits the right note. While drafting, I
wanted to explore the thought of healing (collective trauma, personal
trauma) and the grieving process. Both are typically framed as linear
with some vague yet tangible end. Writing this novel taught me that it
isn’t that at all—it is more cyclical. Like learning the same lessons
and growing just a little with each repetition. Mama Brown’s
deterioration is not unlike what Magnolia experienced of her in her last
days, only in the present, this deterioration is asking Magnolia to
confront how various traumas affect her responses to her environment.
The co-dependence at its core, I think, is a statement of the importance
of holding space for the past to 1.) make sense of the present and 2.)
set in motion what’s needed for a little more softness in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Mama Brown is a particularly effective figure in the novel, appearing
in increasing states of decay (reminding me slightly of the undead
friend in <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>). How did you approach her
presence and her relationship with Magnolia?</strong></p>

<p>In initial drafts, the decay was slower and sometimes reversed for
humor. Magnolia avoids Mama Brown’s request to reflect, naturally. But I
realized I needed a bit more urgency for Magnolia to take Mama Brown’s
request seriously which is how the decay in the final version came
about, how Cricket was born (and by doing this, there was revelation in
Mama Brown’s past—even in afterlife, whiteness remains insidious and
taking).</p>

<p><strong>There are several instances where Magnolia uses her sexuality as a
means of power/survival. Can you discuss how those scenes reveal her
relationship with herself and the world of the book?</strong></p>

<p>Because Magnolia is a Black woman living below the poverty line in the
South, she’s so accustomed to being robbed of agency that even in her
fairytale daydreams, she takes the shape of objects. I wanted Magnolia
to have her own space in which she decided what intimacy should feel
like. Sometimes taking power through these hookups looks like complete
domination, and sometimes she longs for a bit more tenderness but
becomes frustrated when she can’t achieve that—her sexuality grants
her the power she deserves but also becomes a scrambling way of
determining what she lacks.</p>

<p><strong>How has the experience of publishing your first book been for you?</strong></p>

<p>The first draft came quickly and desperately—the revisions, not so
much. Publishing my first book has been so lovely and strange, and I’m
still waiting for the world to blink to black and restart (Pinch me??)</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any advice for aspiring writers who are trying to develop
their own unique voice and perspective in their work?</strong></p>

<p>I think reading broadly is important, as is sitting with the works that
most resonate and studying closely how they achieve what it is that the
aspiring writer admires. Also going out into the world and keeping an
eye out for images that linger, making note of everyday absurdities (and
creating them when they fail to appear).</p>

<p><strong>What's next for you as an author? Are there any other genres or types
of stories you hope to explore in your future writing?</strong></p>

<p>I’m currently revising my second novel—a trailer park noir!</p>
