                <p>What the hell is a <em>book</em> anyway? The more I read them, the less I’m
certain. A living object? A consciousness preserved? A glorified
paperweight? When I thought I’d gotten close to figuring it out, Grant
Maierhofer came along and punted my brain into the stratosphere. I’m
grateful he did.</p>

<p>Maierhofer’s name should be familiar to anyone following the underground
lit scene in this Godforsaken country. His output includes short story
collections, novels that do not behave like novels, and brick shaped
tomes of “ambient nonfiction.” No matter the guise, Maierhofer displays
remarkable dexterity, pushing the confines of language into unexplored
territory that would make Burroughs blush.</p>

<p>The good people at 11:11 Press have collected Maierhofer’s early
writings in the ambitious new collection <em>Works</em>, an omnibus of b-sides
and rarities, if you will. This follows last year’s excellent <em>Drain
Songs</em> (FC2), which yours truly had the good fortune of
<a href="https://www.ligeiamagazine.com/winter-2019/drain-songs-reviewed-by-matt-lee/" target="_blank"><em>reviewing</em></a>.
On the heels of his latest release, I corresponded with Grant to discuss
experimental literature, science fiction, and writing in the face of
pure abjection.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s kick it off. <em>Gag</em> was my introduction to your writing and
I’ve been hooked since. I remember it being such a breath of fresh air
at the time. Reading that book restored a bit of my faith in
contemporary American literature. Before that I’d only heard mutterings
online about <em>Flamingos</em>, but hadn’t read it yet. Naturally I was
excited to see you’ve got an extensive back catalogue. Can you trace a
brief history of the texts compiled in <em>Works</em> for us? How did you
decide what to anthologize?</strong></p>

<p>That’s very kind of you to say and very nice to hear. With <em>Gag, Clog,</em>
and <em>Peripatet</em> there’s such a particular relationship with Inside the
Castle and John Trefry as an editor that I’ve wondered what it’d be like
for someone to read those and then the other stuff. I can’t put my
finger on it but with John the editing experience is unlike anything
else and I’ve always felt different about those books because he pushes
the work into such a unique space. The books collected in <em>Works</em>
probably represent the most formative pieces of writing for me.
<em>Postures</em> is the first time where I’d taken autobiographical source
material but focused way more on sentences as the thing in writing a
novel or fiction in general. <em>Flamingos</em> is the book I wrote when I
found out I was having a daughter and wanted to make a sort of statement
about what I thought fiction could do as an art form. The stories are
new and old, updated and cut, some from <em>Marcel</em> as that’s OOP (the
others are as well, which brought this about as much as anything), as
well as more recent attempts at genre writing, and short fiction is
where I sort of figured out how to approach the bigger projects. And
then, sort of coming full circle, the <em>PX138 3100-2686 User’s Manual</em> is
a project I started quite a while ago, working with the musician Lorn,
where he was creating <em>The Maze to Nowhere</em>, and the manual I wrote was
going to be liner notes for the project. That was put aside for a while,
accepted at Solar Luxuriance, put aside again then accepted at Inside
the Castle, but then I completely rewrote it and it became <em>Clog</em>, so
there is sort of a nice ouroboros model to the book. The manual was also
where I figured out how to do the sort of stuff I did in <em>Gag</em> and
<em>Clog</em>, with translation and converting text to code and back again and
automatic cut up things and the like. We had the first three books and
Andrew at 11:11 felt like something in the Inside the Castle vein would
be nice, so I emailed Lorn and asked if he still had that original file,
and it all came together. Even typing this I’m happy there seems to be a
uniformity to the book I wasn’t consciously thinking about.</p>

<p><strong>What strikes me about <em>Works</em> (and your writing in general) is the
staggering stylistic range. You explore a lot of vastly different
terrain, often in the same book. No matter the approach, you bring an
unmistakable vision and versatility. I’m reminded of the famous John
Peel quip about The Fall—“always different, always the same.”
<em>Postures</em> and <em>PX138 3100-2686 User’s Manual</em> might seem world’s apart
at first glance, but I definitely sense that ouroboros connection you
mentioned. I know the term “experimental fiction” gets overplayed, but
I consider you to be a writer who truly does experiment with language.
Is “experimental fiction” an arbitrary label or a proud tradition or
both? What drives you to push the boundaries of fiction?</strong></p>

<p>Again, very grateful for your reading. I think a phrase like
“experimental fiction” is tough because it skips over figures like
Melville and probably only refers to the 1960s-onward in terms of either
critics calling writing that, or writers owning that with a press like
Fiction Collective in its first iteration. I don’t know where I first
saw this, but I remember someone in the “transgressive” tradition having
an issue with it too, I think because of its religious connotation, and
it aligns Dennis Cooper fairly randomly with someone like Bukowski even
though I don’t think they aspire(d) to the same things in writing at
all. I think it’s useful insofar as it allows someone to connect a
writer’s work on a timeline, and the notion of each book as an
experiment is nice because it allows for failures to kind of be swept up
into the whole enterprise. If I were talking to someone at FedEx, while
shipping a book, and they asked what I write, I might even use the term
as I think it would either dispel their interest or solidify it (most
people would probably think of Joyce, or Pynchon, or “difficult” writers
on hearing the phrase, so it can be useful to at least hint to somebody
they might not care for a book of mine and that’s ok).</p>

<p>In terms of what drives me, I think that I was very moved by a large
enough corpus of writing at just the right time (after sobering up,
sixteen and seventeen, when I truly felt a need for writing and reading
and lucked out in finding artists I admire) that I developed a sense of
fiction (and really any sort of writing) as a life force for certain
types of people, and so over time the notion that I could in turn
contribute to the spirit of this thing has carried me through all these
various projects. Often I’m a very reactive writer, so I’ll think of the
work of others that’s moved me or even the shell of a text that just
proved immersive and curious as a reader, or student, or critic, and
I’ll expand this into a project of my own. Sometimes, with books like
<em>Clog</em>, the feeling of iconoclasm is enough, of disruption. I read <em>The
Place of Dead Roads</em> around the period I just mentioned, and I remember
feeling this sense of permission as a beginning writer. Even if a work
of mine isn’t the thing in and of itself, the hope is that there’s
something there for someone else to take and blow the whole thing to
pieces or something. That’s enough to justify the experimenting, and the
rest of it is this blend of something to express, and a consistent
belief in the power of language in our lives. What the power does I’m a
little less certain, but I’ve been affected by it enough to trust it’s
worthy.</p>

<p><strong>Yeah, I feel like it gets tricky when “experimental lit” is used as
a catchall. Most people wouldn’t apply that term to someone like
Melville even though <em>Pierre</em> is way more out there than most of what
gets called experimental these days. Nice to hear <em>Dead Roads</em> had such
an impact on you. I remember shoplifting a copy of that book from
Borders when I was 16 or so, ha! Similarly had my mind blown. I thought,
“Wow, people can write like this? I should try that!”</strong></p>

<p><strong>The lineage to Burroughs is definitely evident in your new book,
especially in <em>Bleach</em> with stories like “Interzone.” Those writers
who blur the lines of literary fiction and science fiction always
resonate with me—Burroughs, Ballard, Delany, etc. In his introduction
to <em>Bleach</em>, Brian Evenson writes about how you play with genre, using
the techniques of experimental fiction to mutate otherwise familiar
conventions. What are the uses and limits of genre? How would you
respond to the snobs who stick their noses up at anything sci-fi
adjacent?</strong></p>

<p>I think that genre is incredibly important and significant because if
you look at almost any era of genre writing there’s a thriving tradition
of writers within it challenging the limits of what a book can be. With
Delany, no question, and then with Simenon or Highsmith, for crime, or
Theodore Sturgeon for SF. I think the first writer to actually explode
my sense of what genre writing could be was probably Jim Thompson, whose
work I just fell in love with at eighteen or so. Before that I’d
conceived of genre writing as all fitting into this formula that more
closely reflected an episode of <em>Law and Order</em> or something rather than
something anarchic and expressive. Thompson felt like reading John Fante
or something but it was almost better because he’d also shown clear
concern for engaging the reader wherever possible, whether it’s plot or
visceral images or whatever. Then discovering stuff like <em>A Sweet Sweet
Summer</em> by Jane Gaskell sort of continued this feeling of realizing the
experimenting that happened within genre and I think Delany kind of
finalized everything. What’s nice though is I’m able to read stuff like
Delany’s <em>The Mad Man</em> (my favorite of his I think) and it feels like a
continuation of reading <em>Dhalgren</em>, or even his <em>The Motion of Light in
Water</em> (in my opinion one of the greatest memoirs ever written) and the
experience feels connected to his genre work.</p>

<p>I think that right now there’s a weird dynamic with SF because of
Silicon Valley. The figures there are often referring to science fiction
as inspiration and that’s the only thing I might sort of stop paying
attention to w/r/t genre. I haven’t noticed as much snobbery from
elsewhere regarding genre I guess because I tend to learn about and
engage with genre stuff with others who are just excited about the work
being done. I do think it’s a problem especially in terms of learning
how to write (academically or otherwise) and in that area I’m far more
drawn to David Foster Wallace’s approach of teaching popular works to
show there’s just as much experimentation and ambition there as there is
in Carver or whoever else is taught as standard in writing programs.
Genre literature is also one strand of literature that seems to have
figured out how to compensate its writers fairly well. Money can’t
really be a reason to write with things as they are, but even for
publishing a story or two of science fiction there’s been more
compensation than I’ve received for a year’s royalties. And on top of
that I felt as engaged and taken with the process of writing those
stories as I have with anything I’ve written.</p>

<p><strong>Man, Thompson is a God. <em>Savage Night</em> is one of my all-time
favorites. Delany’s trajectory is pretty incredible when you look at
the early, pulpy sci-fi/fantasy stuff next to something like <em>Hogg.</em>
Absolutely agree that you can tell it’s all an extension of the same
imagination though. People shouldn’t scoff at reading something
mainstream or popular. I always got a kick out of DFW being a Tom Clancy
fan. I admire a lack of pretension.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In contrast to something like the <em>Gag</em>/<em>Clog</em>/<em>Peripatet</em> trilogy,
much of <em>Works</em> has a more concrete narrative quality. Nothing I would
call “traditional” by any stretch, but perhaps more structurally
familiar. With that in mind, you’ve created some wonderfully weird and
sometimes disturbing individuals whose headspace we get to inhabit. How
do you approach developing a character, whether it’s the semi
autobiographical X from <em>Postures</em>, the disembodied voices of
<em>Flamingos</em>, the serial killer in the title story of <em>Bleach</em>, or even
the all-consuming saw in <em>PX138 3100-2686 User’s Manual</em>? What makes for
a compelling character in fiction?</strong></p>

<p>I think when it comes to developing a character, or even just a vague
perspective, for the most part it has to start with voice, which in turn
has to start with language. Often that means one sentence, usually an
opening, which is somehow curious. I remember working on “Everybody’s
Darling,” which is collected in <em>Drain Songs</em>, and it all emanated from
the line “I suppose I took to wearing mother’s unders” and there was
maybe more to it than that, or the final version changed, but that line
almost just seemed like a fun body to inhabit. And from there some more
lines come, and it becomes clear it’s a story about a person in
mourning. That line, too, had a connection to reading, as I was thinking
of the first (I think it’s first, anyway) story in <em>Venus Drive</em> with
the strange maternal stuff at her bedside.</p>

<p>That’s sort of one way it’ll happen, I’ll need to find a vessel for some
language I’m interested in, and once I start to nag at that a little bit
it’ll either start to go somewhere, or it won’t, in which case it might
be a fragment of a novel, or it might be abandoned.</p>

<p>With X, though, since I’m not exactly inventing situations but creating
an amalgam of lived experience and imaginary stuff, it’s almost the
opposite. The language comes easily as I’m just riffing, the lowest
possible stakes at the beginning, and hopefully I’ve got enough that I
can start to rewrite that, and through three or four full rewrites I’ll
start to really focus on the language, and the reshaping will come
naturally enough after that.</p>

<p>In terms of what makes for a compelling character in fiction, for me,
there usually has to be some focus on the language, some oddity that
comes through there, that makes it compelling. I’d connect this from the
often nameless characters in Lish-edited or Lish-inspired writers’
works, to the wanderers in <em>Dhalgren</em>, even through to someone like
Hannibal Lecter in those novels, there’s a sense that language is a tool
to heed, to respect and follow, and these characters are brought into
existence by respecting the language they seem to need to be written out
by someone. Often the quickest way to sense this is the language, but it
isn’t always the case as there’s much to enjoy in writers only
glancingly interested in prose. I think in my favorite characters form
and content are so bound up as to be unnoticeable separately. I’m
thinking of books like <em>The Trick is to Keep Breathing</em>, which sort of
enacts the drama of a mental illness memoir on the page, or even the
diaries of May Sarton, or the referential and fragmented narration in
Tan Lin’s work, we can sense the author’s presence usually, and in
compelling fictional characters (or nonfictional really) seem to occur
when the author is transcribing as much as composing.</p>

<p><strong>Interesting how an author’s voice and a character’s voice can bend
against one another. It becomes a kind of paradox where the author is
both organically channelling and consciously manufacturing language.
Some characters seem like they almost demand to be realized. Our job
then is to pick up those idiosyncrasies and decipher what this imaginary
consciousness is trying to communicate.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Speaking of process, I think it’s safe to say you’re a prolific
author. You’ve put out more books in five years than some do in a
lifetime. It’s also clear to me that even at their most abstract
you’ve dedicated a lot of time to writing and revising these texts. Do
you stick to a strict regimen when you’re working on a book? How do you
make time for creative endeavors while juggling family and career
obligations?</strong></p>

<p>Usually when I’m working on something I’ll write it in short bursts,
maybe two or three a day, but when I feel my wheels spinning a little
bit I’ll need to stop and then it might start up again better the next
day or I’ll wait a bit before getting back into it. I guess that’s the
method with shorter things. Otherwise it’ll depend on my relationship
with who’s putting the book out, and whether an agreement was made
before the thing was totally finalized or not. With John at Inside the
Castle every book was basically collaborative, where I sent him
something at the outset and through working together the final book was
reached after a number of months. With ITNA, who first published
<em>Flamingos</em> they were nice enough to work with me based on a document
assembled after reading and loving Matthew Roberson’s <em>1998.6,</em> that was
an absolute mess, and bring Travis Jeppesen on board to edit the thing
into what finally became the text as it is now. Right now I’m working on
a book on professional wrestling with Reaktion Books that was accepted
conditionally based on an outline, and that’s taken the majority of my
time, and I work on it a little bit most days.</p>

<p>I don’t write every day, and I don’t think that’s a prerequisite for
anything as a writer, and the same goes for reading religiously to be
honest. If a writer feels less compelled to read, as all people do these
days, then I think following that is more important than imposing strict
rules on yourself, because you’re more likely to write something
reflective of the world and the people in it that way. Not that that’s a
necessity in writing, I just like the idea of people angry about books
and writing and reading or at least disenchanted with it writing books,
as I’m way more likely to read those as they seem more honest.</p>

<p>In terms of making time, I tend to email myself pieces of projects
lately. This wrestling book is vaguely academic so I’ll often bring up a
couple of PDFs or something and peruse them and then send myself
sequences of emails throughout the day that I’ll assemble when my kids
go to sleep. I have three kids under 5 so those moments throughout the
day are few and far between, but usually there’s enough if you’re not
too particular about having to sit at a desk to get anything substantial
done. Then there’s that time in the evening which I’ll either use a bit
or spend watching tv with my wife or something but those small moments
have proven enough to keep going. I know some people are adamant that
you need to be at the desk or you need to be super selfish with your
time or something to really do anything as a writer or artist, but
honestly the writers and artists who make do while living real lives
mean way more to me anyway—Mierle Laderman Ukeles, or Christine Schutt
are great examples and have served very well as direct inspirations on
however I’ve managed to do anything.</p>

<p><strong>Hadn’t realized Jeppesen edited <em>Flamingos</em>! I’m a big fan of <em>The
Suiciders</em>. Refreshing to hear you don’t set a rigid work schedule.
Seems somewhat robotic/masochistic to force yourself to read or write,
as well as less genuine. I like the anecdote about Schutt writing
<em>Nightwork</em> while her kids were asleep—hence the title.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I noticed <em>Works</em> is rife with allusions to films, particularly French
cinema—Renoir, Godard, Cocteau. These are filmmakers whose work has a
certain literary quality, especially Cocteau since he dabbled in both
worlds. What is your relationship with film and how does it intersect
with your writing? Do you see any parallels between cinema and
literature?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, Schutt is just unbelievable in every respect, very grateful her
writing exists. I think the film stuff probably hooked me before
literature. I remember when I still did drugs I would often skip school
and take a box of Benadryl and whatever else was around and watch movies
and I think aside from punk shows it was the first time I remember
feeling like I was engaging something aesthetically powerful. Cocteau I
think I read first and then watched his movies, so it probably wound up
doubly inspiring as a result. I remember reading his journals <em>Past
Tense</em> and his book on opium and it just floored me how engaged he
seemed in any medium he touched. The same goes for Pasolini. They’re
both poets in the old sense I think, and Pasolini’s Trilogy of Life is
probably as informative for me as any work of literature. It’s
constantly referential and human and hilarious. I think a lot of my
favorite contemporary writers are very inflected by films, especially
that 60s French stuff for someone like Dennis Cooper, or DeLillo, or
even Rachel Kushner. I imagine that down the line the parallels between
film and fiction or literature will be more clearly established, as the
kind of writing I’m into feels very contemporary and very responsive to
the perceived death of the field and the same has sort of happened to
film of late.</p>

<p>The nice thing about film is it’s mostly held onto its role as this
thing people from all walks of life will seek out for being sort of
experimental and arty, with stuff like <em>Uncut Gems</em> or <em>Portrait of a
Lady on Fire</em> or even back to <em>Prisoners</em> and <em>The Master</em>. These are
all films a huge number of people saw and were happy to engage as
artworks in the same theaters where <em>Trolls 2</em> or whatever were also
shown. There’s something nice about that, like going to check out Oakley
Hall’s <em>Warlock</em> from the public library and finding out someone in your
small town has it checked out. It seems like people do wish that books
held that sort of sway and I guess I understand but it’s also nice to
feel like you’re accessing something special and content to remain
outside the world itself.</p>

<p><strong>I’m getting flashbacks to my own teenage phase of doing triple c’s
and watching Fulci movies. Those were the days… I think the
accessibility of film allows for more “high art” to crossover into the
mainstream. It’s pretty wild seeing recent movies like <em>The Lighthouse</em>
or <em>Parasite</em> playing in theaters. Interesting time to be alive, to say
the least.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The midwest features prominently in a lot of your work. I must confess
I’ve spent little time out there—I’m an east coaster. I feel like
middle America gets a bad rap for whatever reason. I’m always curious
how the geography surrounding an author can seep into their writing.
Have those landscapes and cultures influenced your perspective? What
does the midwest symbolize to you?</strong></p>

<p>The Midwest is very strange, because on the one hand it’s known for this
very self-deprecating niceness, and on the other it’s produced as many
noted serial killers as the Pacific Northwest. I live in the Pacific
Northwest now, and I think its main differences from the Midwest have to
do with landscape. I think probably the biggest effect landscape and
culture have had on me have had to do with recovery and the like. Going
to rehab in the Midwest where there is this massive thriving recovery
community affected how I see things, and definitely how I write, as I
first really started writing while in treatment, in Minnesota, which is
sometimes called the Land of 10,000 Treatment Centers.</p>

<p>I think, in addition to this, there’s a sense of wanting to stand behind
the stories and things that make your place of origin significant for
you. I think that places like LA, or New York City, or the south more
broadly have received so much coverage in literature that there is this
feeling of wanting to convey this place I come from so it gets its due.
Lots of brilliant writers have come from the Midwest, though, so there
is a tradition to engage with, but I think everybody tends to pull from
this sense of memory they have and want to give that back in their
writing.</p>

<p>I think, with that in mind, the Midwest symbolizes a lot of strange
failures of promise. The niceness counteracted by police violence and
circumstances in places like Chicago where the government has all but
given up on helping communities there torn apart by violence. The
sweethearts you might meet buying bread on Sunday morning versus the
legacy of Ed Gein. Even the reason lots of immigrants came to the
Midwest, the promise of logging and farming advertised in Germany and
Poland and elsewhere but when they arrived the ground was full of stumps
and the logging boom had already started moving further westward.
Underneath that too though there is an enduring magic to it, a warmth.
That section near <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, where he’s talking about taking
the trains home in the winter in his youth, and passing these sleepy
towns and feeling good that he’s of this place, that’s still there for
me.</p>

<p><strong>Recently reread <em>The Great Gatsby</em> for the first time since high
school and found it incredibly disturbing in a way I hadn’t remembered.
It was like, “Wow, these rich people are just pure evil.” Sadly this
country is still run by a soulless upper class with unlimited access to
wealth and power. Probably why that book has remained so relevant over
the years.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In David Vichnar’s masterful
<a href="https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/the-work-that-matters-seven-notes-on-grant-maierhofers-works/" target="_blank"><em>afterword</em></a>
to <em>Works</em>, there’s an excerpt from your “Research Notes” for
<em>Flamingos</em> where you mention that language is a type of lie we use to
paint different versions of the same reality. Literature can be a means
to counter “shifting definitions” since language can often manipulate
people in dangerous ways. This has become so pronounced lately, as
language has often served to divide us or placate us. Data about the
Coronavirus pandemic meant to save lives is rendered “conspiracy
theory.” Peaceful protestors get depicted as “riotous thugs.” I’ve
been thinking a lot about what purpose art can serve in support of the
fight against police brutality and racism. I’m trying to resist the
voice in my head saying, “Your writing is irrelevant in the face of
state sanctioned murder and an ever mounting COVID-19 death toll and a
fascist administration trying to strip us of the most basic human
rights.” This year has forced me to reconsider the purpose of art in
general. As writers, how can we use our craft to combat oppression and
inequality? Is all writing political? Or was Artaud right about all
writing being pigshit?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve thought about Chaucer on a lot of occasions lately for a lot of
different reasons, but it applies pretty well here. What’s nice about
<em>The Canterbury Tales</em> is they’re a literature born of the Black Plague.
Several works have stood the test of time that were written around the
time or about the subject of the Black Plague. That’s important because
Chaucer’s work isn’t only steeped in death. It’s a book about a bunch of
weirdos telling stories while they make this walk to honor a hero while
everything is literally and figuratively falling apart around them. It
reminds me of that amazing monologue Francis Ford Coppola gives at the
end of <em>Hearts of Darkness</em>, talking about the universal stories that
exist and what he was trying to do with <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. The first
winter of man and this sense that everything was going to fall apart and
die and life was over, but then spring came and life flourished and was
better again. Like Chaucer, he’s talking about telling stories and
creating art in the face of total misery and abjection, staring at the
hideous state of things on the tail of the Vietnam War and all this
ugliness about humanity being unearthed simultaneously. The same is true
of literature focused on the holocaust, on slavery, on anything that’s
brought civilization face to face with its ugliest tendencies and forced
a reckoning to boil. This means that this stuff serious writers are
trying to do will always have some purpose or matter in the grand scheme
of things. With the means to write and publish at everyone’s fingertips
it also means that not everything will be helmed as this era’s
<em>Canterbury Tales</em> or even <em>In Our Time</em>, but the effort will always
matter.</p>

<p>I think in terms of all writing being political, it’s maybe useful to
think that all things <em>can</em> be political, or <em>can have</em> political
implications, because outright asserting that all writing is political,
for instance, is a mental trap that seems very difficult to be able to
escape from as the person trying to write something. I feel like even a
while ago you could more comfortably come up with things having zero
political implication, like when reading your question I thought about
whether pouring a glass of tap water is political, and was immediately
reminded of Flint, Michigan. Maybe that means things have always held
more political implication than we’ve realized, which is why I’m
comfortable with the idea that everything can. I think writing is but
I’m more likely to give it credit in terms of its political implications
than see them as purely negative. I think, sort of connecting with your
first question, that when the language of the world is attempting to
skew things for us, and tell us things are a certain way, that writing
as an artform can serve to enhance our relationship with language and
understand things more fully. The world’s language is chaotic, sales,
paranoia, money, whatever. Literary language can respond to this by
being restrained, or rambling, concise or Proustian, and like Abstract
Expressionism can represent things that another painting of a pot of
flowers cannot.</p>

<p>Artaud’s interesting because he’s romanticized nowadays but when you
actually look at the circumstances of his life it’s pretty abysmal. We
hear a lot about how treatment for those with mental illness has
improved, and that’s definitely true, and Artaud was someone who lived
through some of the absolute worst of it, and what he managed to write
in spite of that is truly astounding. I think perhaps Artaud was
responding to things like the Lost Generation, and this romantic view of
the human spirit, and he saw through much of it, and his declaration of
writing as pigshit is bound up in that, that man is sort of just as
despicable as any animal we apparently lord over, and our writing might
as well be scrawled on the walls of a prison in shit. I think it’s also
bound up in his desires for the theater, a more confrontational and
abject thing to be thrown in the face of the general populace instead of
pored over by bored students. I do think that there should be something
despicable and human in the work, for it to really matter, some level of
the human ugliness we’re capable of. There should be that risk or
vulnerability somewhere, otherwise it’s tough to stick with it.</p>

<p><strong>Damn, what an incredibly (and unsurprisingly) thoughtful response. I
was reading about how the Black Plague ultimately triggered the
renaissance. Italy was so badly hit that it forced a shift in
worldview—people had been confronted by all this death and they
started being more concerned with their lives on earth than the
spiritual afterlife, leading to advances in medicine, technology, art,
etc. I wonder if we make art because of or in spite of the ugliness of
humanity. It is pretty badass that a person can suffer untold atrocities
and still create something beautiful or meaningful. Even Artaud for all
his vitriol was sort of “saved” later in his life when he landed in a
hospital where they had him practice art therapy instead of
electroshock. I think language does hold a lot of power and the better
we understand its nuances and complexities, the less likely we are to
succumb to its manipulative potential. Helps us to think more
critically, therefore (hopefully) leading us away from extremity. The
best political art challenges our assumptions and demands us to confront
human nature at its worst, while also allowing us to imagine a better
future.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I understand you teach (or taught) composition. I wanted to wrap up
our conversation by asking what advice you would offer a fledgling
writer. Someone like X, perhaps, who’s hungry to write a masterpiece
but disenchanted with academia and publishing. What do you wish someone
had told you when you first started out?</strong></p>

<p>Very grateful for all your kindness here. I’m still teaching, mainly
composition and technical writing sorts of courses, but I’ve been lucky
to teach some creative writing here and there. I think there would be
two primary things I would tell someone like X, where maybe the ambition
and desire to do something significant can seem to outweigh the actual
work at hand for those first couple of years or so. The first, would be
to focus on sentences as much as you possibly can. When I started
writing I did it because I loved literature, and I loved the feeling
certain books gave me. I thought, as a result, that the thing to focus
on was that feeling, and if you could have that energy carrying you
through the writing process then you would arrive at an end object as
powerful as the books you love. I do think that’s part of it, but when
I’d go back to edit that stuff it would feel so awkward and
uncomfortable because I hadn’t really thought about language or
sentences. In my case this unfortunately meant that I still pushed so
hard that some of that writing was published, but you live and you learn
I guess.</p>

<p>I first tried focusing on sentences for their sake alone around when I’d
finished a draft of <em>Postures,</em> and from then on I’ve remained concerned
about the language of what I’m doing. It took me a while though to
realize that a huge reason I had such a response to certain writers was
because they’d paid close attention to language and done interesting
things with it, it wasn’t just because the writers cared about art in
the same way I did and that energy translated. There’s a wonderful and
easy-to-read book by Virginia Tufte called <em>Artful Sentences</em> that I’d
recommend to any writer at any point in their life. It illustrates what
I’m talking about better than I ever could. The second thing that I
would recommend would be to review books, to some degree, in some
capacity, so as to try and become a member of the many various
communities devoted to all types of literature there now are. I started
reviewing stuff at HTMLGIANT way back when, and have continued to try
and do so wherever possible. You get free books which is nice, and you
help others all while exploring what literature is doing at present.
Some places even pay you for it, I’m told, but regardless it’s a
fulfilling thing and seeing what your peers are doing is exciting. If
you want a model of how to do this, follow the efforts of Mike Corrao.
He’s a critic with the best of them and seems to publish a new review
every day that he isn’t also publishing a new book, which is often. He’s
a literary citizen with the best of them and he shows how writing isn’t
all solitary drudgery hidden away from things, it can be social and
dynamic. I’m reasonably sure that if you are able to do some variation
of both of these things that you will get writing done you feel good
about, and will just as likely get published.</p>
