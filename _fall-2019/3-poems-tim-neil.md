## No Parking Today---Funeral

<div class="stanza">
  <p class="poemline">The sign sprouting from the hole</p>
  <p class="poemline">in the orange traffic cone is dirty,</p>
  <p class="poemline">its face caked by the smog</p>
  <p class="poemline">of passing cars.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
  <p class="poemline">People march by like worker ants,</p>
  <p class="poemline">collecting crumbs of comfort.</p>
  <p class="poemline">This is aging.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
  <p class="poemline">Deathdays mask the aluminum</p>
  <p class="poemline">face with beloved skins</p>
  <p class="poemline">and now, you can read only</p>
  <p class="poemline">what it lets you read.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
  <p class="poemline">If you look to it for sympathy, it</p>
  <p class="poemline">looks back.</p>
  <p class="poemline">If you ask about grief, all it will</p>
  <p class="poemline">tell you is that grief is a grey gutter,</p>
  <p class="poemline">a place you can’t stay.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
  <p class="poemline">Circled around the sign, three old</p>
  <p class="poemline">men burn their cigarettes down</p>
  <p class="poemline">to nubs, like children</p>
  <p class="poemline">in a game of straws.</p>
</div>

## On a Balcony with an Imagined Beach

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Sitting with the first bloom</p>
<p class="poemline">of your toad-lily between us,</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">we sip coffee and practice addictions.</p>
<p class="poemline">Must we leave? I want to ignore the day</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and curl up with you like tangled vines,</p>
<p class="poemline">cloak our Wednesday in questions.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">We don’t need all the answers.</p>
<p class="poemline">I can wear the unknown</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">like your black morning dress.</p>
<p class="poemline">The breeze rhymes with how you breathe</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">in Spirits. You have a gardener’s grace,</p>
<p class="poemline">you weight my name with tender soil. I blather</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">like a bad poem, and offer apologies</p>
<p class="poemline">for my housefly mind. We talk about words,</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">placing “soothsayer” on my tongue;</p>
<p class="poemline">it tastes fertile. <em>What is the beginning</em></p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline"><em>of a day,</em> you ask. A sleepy hornet walking</p>
<p class="poemline">between two people with decisions to make.</p>
</div>

## Pigeon in a Spring Rain

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">While the sideways rain</p>
<p class="poemline">pummeled my pruned muscles,</p>
<p class="poemline">I thought I saw you</p>
<p class="poemline">squint at me, until I turned</p>
<p class="poemline">and saw beautiful faces</p>
<p class="poemline">papering over open air,</p>
<p class="poemline">like a bedroom wall,</p>
<p class="poemline">at the end</p>
<p class="poemline">of your street.</p>
<p class="poemline">You greeted them,</p>
<p class="poemline">with waves and half-winks,</p>
<p class="poemline">And washed away</p>
<p class="poemline">in the rain, tinging</p>
<p class="poemline">the gutter stream</p>
<p class="poemline">a neon pink.</p>
<p class="poemline">While I, left outside</p>
<p class="poemline">with your worn green couch,</p>
<p class="poemline">stared at the wall of faces.</p>
<p class="poemline">They looked at me</p>
<p class="poemline">with an awe reserved</p>
<p class="poemline">for a city pigeon</p>
<p class="poemline">who refuses to cede</p>
<p class="poemline">any ground, and so</p>
<p class="poemline">is left behind.</p>
</div>
