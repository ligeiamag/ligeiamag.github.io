<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">What must it feel like</p>  
<p class="poemline">To be burned all along your consciousness</p>
<p class="poemline">To feel your senses ignite</p>  
<p class="poemline">Like a live wire as your skin</p>
<p class="poemline">Slowly melts away to its hollow</p>
<p class="poemline">Recesses, revealing pure white</p>
<p class="poemline">Bone</p>
