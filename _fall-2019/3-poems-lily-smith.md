## A Moment of Reflection from Jackie Kennedy

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I undress now as your widow,</p>
<p class="poemline">my thoughts sometimes lingering on all the times</p>
<p class="poemline">I undressed as your wife&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">your hand gliding down the pleats of my spine</p>
<p class="poemline">guiding down the teeth of my zipper&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">to expose the slick of my slip.</p>
<p class="poemline">I wonder how many others had you this way,</p>
<p class="poemline">how many freckled backs met your gaze.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">A woman&rsquo;s back is full of secrets&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">a sea creature pulsing in shadow.</p>
<p class="poemline">Men don&rsquo;t have secrets. Or, at least, you never did.</p>
<p class="poemline">Men of your calibre don&rsquo;t need them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">Though perhaps as a courtesy for me, dear,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">you could have labored.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I tried to leave you about a dozen times, you know.</p>
<p class="poemline">How foolish, I thought, even then&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">though I&rsquo;d hardly call myself a martyr&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">for what you&rsquo;d call my &ldquo;little knickknacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poemline">I&rsquo;ve always had a head for furnishings.</p>
<p class="poemline">You had such a beautiful head, dear.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">And to think some silly little Communist&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">the strawberry Chanel your favorite number&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">splashed with blood, caked with hair and&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">accented with the most delicate parts of your skull.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">So many pieces...I tried to keep it all in.</p>
<p class="poemline">In that moment, I wasn&rsquo;t sure who I was to you.</p>
<p class="poemline">I thought if I could just keep you all together&hellip;</p>
<p class="poemline">But I knew you were dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Dusk has become my favorite hour,</p>
<p class="poemline">time soft like a rabbit&rsquo;s ear, daylight wincing</p>
<p class="poemline">through my fingers like so many calloused dreams,</p>
<p class="poemline">the tan lines from my wedding ring once</p>
<p class="poemline">defiant, now long faded.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">I was what you needed when the pies dried up,</p>
<p class="poemline">when you had your fill, popped the cherry of History</p>
<p class="poemline">and left her doubled over, puking from the quaaludes.</p>
<p class="poemline">Our marriage was an instrument of Time&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">Daddy groomed me for my pick of sadists.</p>
<p class="poemline">There were times I thought no atlas could reach you.</p>
<p class="poemline">Loving you...certainly the worst way to get to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">Didn&rsquo;t think I knew about the duckies?</p>
<p class="poemline">Such a curse for a girl to be bright&hellip;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I suppose it was too much to ask we grow old&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">together, to see our children grow up together.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">I once thought, cradling your head like I had so many</p>
<p class="poemline">times before, so many times in the dark night</p>
<p class="poemline">after our lovemaking, fierce and frenzied and desperate,</p>
<p class="poemline">&nbsp;that no one had you like I had you. You were too</p>
<p class="poemline">much for this world, like our children doomed,</p>
<p class="poemline">growing and fading in my crooked womb.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">Where were you?&nbsp; And where was God?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">Oh if we should ever meet&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">I&rsquo;d gladly shake his hand before I cut the damned&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">thing off! How many backs, Jack? How many Sirens&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">called your name? Before anything else, I am a woman&hellip;</p>
<p class="poemline">How many biddies held your full attention like&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">I held the pieces of your precious head in&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">those final moments? I give myself permission to no&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">longer wonder anymore. I was past wondering&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">on that plane, your brain matter sparkling on the</p>
<p class="poemline">boucl&eacute; wool like the ripest pearls.</p>

## Snowball Fights in Connecticut

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Sometimes when I&rsquo;m lonely&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">I dream up your childhood, meditate</p>
<p class="poemline">on what it feels like to be you then,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">walk the thresholds of your house.</p>
<p class="poemline">Your siblings on each other&rsquo;s heels.</p>
<p class="poemline">The snowball fights in Connecticut.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The silence between your parents</p>
<p class="poemline">that filled up the breakfast table.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">It makes sense. How you get sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The first time you kissed a girl,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">felt her freckled thighs, maneuvered your</p>
<p class="poemline">rough hands over her penny nipples,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">hard working hands for a boy your age.</p>
<p class="poemline">She was a few years older than you, but by</p>
<p class="poemline">that time you&rsquo;d seen fifty dead bodies,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">at least, digging graves that summer.</p>
<p class="poemline">Listened to Pink Floyd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wish You Were&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">Here&rdquo; twice that much, contemplating&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">heaven and all the hell you&rsquo;d raised.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">The melted snow grieving from pelting</p>
<p class="poemline">the faces of strangers soon to be buried.</p>
</div>

## The Chocolate Tiger

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Parentica melaneus:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">honey blue and primal brown&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">the color of mercy, bowels,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">and funeral home blazers</p>
<p class="poemline">(of which I am too familiar.)</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The sullen outlines aching&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">purple like wings dipped in a bruise,</p>
<p class="poemline">blackberry-blooded</p>
<p class="poemline">with humble veins to map</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">its howling, savage heart.</p>
<p class="poemline">Fearless against the sky, it winks</p>
<p class="poemline">with an unflinching wild eye</p>
<p class="poemline">like my father's&mdash;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">delicate and virtuous&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">weary in the face of death.</p>
<p class="poemline">Sick collected in his body like</p>
<p class="poemline">a secret in the open dark and&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">groomed him for his coronation</p>
<p class="poemline">as my daddy, King of Decay.</p>
<p class="poemline">Once he showed me where</p>
<p class="poemline">cancer had mapped him</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">in freckled heaving notches,</p>
<p class="poemline">tumor for grapefruit-sized tumor&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">gaunt like a starving moon.</p>
<p class="poemline">They dug and dug and dug on him</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">with such misshapen symmetry,</p>
<p class="poemline">and I said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">Through gleaming gritted teeth his&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">smile hung on me;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I saw the devil&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemline">a snarled noose with lucrative&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">knots, spots before my eyes</p>
<p class="poemline">like fireflies against the colors</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of my eyelids, against the burnt&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">orange-blue of its fluttering, and&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">I could taste the ruin in my feet,</p>
<p class="poemline">pink against the dark salt earth.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Mired with a sprinter's pulse,</p>
<p class="poemline">I built my home in the church of the</p>
<p class="poemline">trees. Knees buckling under</p>
<p class="poemline">willful branches, I hardened there&mdash;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">forged myself into a gilded&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">chrysalis before the rotting world</p>
<p class="poemline">in wait. I surrendered to the&nbsp;</p>
<p class="poemline">lonely sun and did not look back.</p>
</div>
