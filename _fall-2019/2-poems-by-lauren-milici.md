## We're Not, But We Could Be

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A glowing white house</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tucked beneath the trees</p>

<p class="poemline">&amp; the too-quiet hallway</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that leads to your door. </p>

<p class="poemline">Home feels like this, I think—</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sacred, without question.</p>

<p class="poemline">As if we’ve always lived here.</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if we built this</p>

<p class="poemline">together.</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do silly things now, like daydream</p>

<p class="poemline">about the honeygreentea scent of your skin, </p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or buy plastic toys for your sweet, destructive cat, </p>

<p class="poemline">&amp; worry, a lot. </p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a softness here, </p>

<p class="poemline">but it’s young and doesn’t know</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what it wants to be yet. </p>

<p class="poemline">It whispers, <em>I am going as slowly as I can.</em> </p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s never loved, but it’s learning. </p>

## Eve Was Framed
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Today, a boy says, <em>good news: I love you again,</em></p>

<p class="poemline">as if this were a gift. As if all men were God.</p>

<p class="poemline">Instead, church bells. A forgotten hymn from the Book of Revelation&mdash;</p>

<p class="poemline">something that hurts in a way John could never find a name for.</p>

<p class="poemline">Luckily, the past is never dead. It's not even past.</p>

<p class="poemline">In a memory, the surgeon hands me a warm bag of my own blood.</p>

<p class="poemline">Say this aloud. It will not protect you.</p>
