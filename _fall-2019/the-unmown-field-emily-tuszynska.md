<div class="stanza">
  <p class="poemline">Fifteen years and even I</p>
  <p class="poemline">who watched every season</p>
  <p class="poemline">of its changing can no longer</p>
  <p class="poemline">remember the field</p>
  <p class="poemline">thatâ€™s grown over.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Sheltered by snow-toppled</p>
  <p class="poemline">grasses, the green shoots</p>
  <p class="poemline">of trees hardened,</p>
  <p class="poemline">and by the first June</p>
  <p class="poemline">red cedars tongued</p>
  <p class="poemline">the air above bluestem.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Nothing lasts. Not the field,</p>
  <p class="poemline">not my girlhood, not the baby</p>
  <p class="poemline">I carried until the next came</p>
  <p class="poemline">behind him. Now my daughter</p>
  <p class="poemline">is the one who is young,</p>
  <p class="poemline">and already too heavy</p>
  <p class="poemline">to carry. Doves croon</p>
  <p class="poemline">to her from new pines</p>
  <p class="poemline">as they did from the pines</p>
  <p class="poemline">of my childhood. The sorrow </p>
  <p class="poemline">in their song is the sorrow</p>
  <p class="poemline">of the human listener,</p>
  <p class="poemline">old sorrow that somehow</p>
  <p class="poemline">I knew even then.</p>
