## We're Not, But We Could Be

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A glowing white house</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tucked beneath the trees</p>

<p class="poemline">&amp; the too-quiet hallway</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that leads to your door. </p>

<p class="poemline">Home feels like this, I think—</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sacred, without question.</p>

<p class="poemline">As if we’ve always lived here.</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if we built this</p>

<p class="poemline">together.</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do silly things now, like daydream</p>

<p class="poemline">about the honeygreentea scent of your skin, </p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or buy plastic toys for your sweet, destructive cat, </p>

<p class="poemline">&amp; worry, a lot. </p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a softness here, </p>

<p class="poemline">but it’s young and doesn’t know</p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what it wants to be yet. </p>

<p class="poemline">It whispers, <em>I am going as slowly as I can.</em> </p>

<p class="poemline">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s never loved, but it’s learning. </p>
