<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">His backyard held the only pool we knew</p>
<p class="poemline">its deep end moulded like a pelican’s beak—</p>
<p class="poemline">so gentle was the roll-in that you flew</p>
<p class="poemline">straight up the vert wall. At first you felt sick</p>
<p class="poemline">at all that loss of gravity, but then</p>
<p class="poemline">the feeling stuck, grew stronger every time</p>
<p class="poemline">your nose approached the depth-marker—<em>10</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>ft</em>. You’d gulp a mouthful of air and climb</p>
<p class="poemline">just higher than your comfort zone allowed</p>
<p class="poemline">body compressed as fingers kissed blue tile’s</p>
<p class="poemline">virgin promise—and friends don’t need to goad</p>
<p class="poemline">you on at that point. Trial by trial</p>
<p class="poemline">it’s waited you out; now you see it for</p>
<p class="poemline">the first time, as it slams you to the floor.</p>
</div>
