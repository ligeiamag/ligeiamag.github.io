<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The earliest memory I have of seeing wonder in liminal spaces</p>
<p class="poemline">is the Lac Rose in Senegal, a fairytale pond, and I am a fairytale princess</p>
<p class="poemline">pirate mermaid in a pixie dust soup</p>
<p class="poemline">spent my childhood in a mythology of sorts</p>
<p class="poemline">halfway between the color and the puckered mouth that always tried to suction it away</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I was three when the Dakar deluge brought an avalanche of ants in its wake</p>
<p class="poemline">the first I ever touched on terror, a phobia that would latch onto me forever</p>
<p class="poemline">not the rain — the rain I loved from the moment it sprayed my arid soul — but the ants</p>
<p class="poemline">swarm of fitful frenzy in my grandmother’s garden</p>
<p class="poemline">taught me how easily chaos could upset comfort</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">But that’s not all I remember</p>
<p class="poemline">just as they streamed around me: floating</p>
<p class="poemline">swept in my uncle’s solid arms</p>
<p class="poemline">we became an island in the middle of the crawling storm</p>
<p class="poemline">and just as I had known fear, I knew what love was</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Even when years later a cloud of locusts descended upon Nouakchott</p>
<p class="poemline">and ate through everything</p>
<p class="poemline">sunlight crisscrossed, the air a click-click of wings </p>
<p class="poemline">and snapping pinchers </p>
<p class="poemline">it felt prophetic, biblical, formidable in its scale</p>
</div>

<p>Later, in different cities, we would try to replicate the feeling of being protagonists in a magical realism season, and although it came close, was never really close; Arctic Monkeys and golden colored hues in Chicago; streetlamps that pulled the focus onto blue moon territory in Washington DC; in Libreville, freckled wetness dappling the sound of the world; Paris bringing with its scent of blossoms a lyricism from another time; Nairobi and its multitudinous textures, like running fingers through multiverses</p>


<p>In Montréal we almost made it, losing hours in the darkened rooms of the Dollar Cinema place that smelled of vinegar and feet, watching films we didn’t care for but felt we had to, because they were essentially free and we could afford it, enduring one too many found footage plots and letting tolerance run its course, and knowing we deserved more, but bonding over the shared ridiculousness of this patchwork kind of fun</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When I think of childhood I think of</p>
<p class="poemline">all the times I got lost in old mattress stores in Maryland</p>
<p class="poemline">believing we would die during Y2K and relishing the thrill</p>
<p class="poemline">reading Archie comics and responding to Veronica, but pretending I was a Betty</p>
<p class="poemline">wandering in the labyrinthine halls of the Jeepers arcade</p>
<p class="poemline">quiet summer shades, caterpillars curled around my index</p>
<p class="poemline">fevered days off from school, watching science documentaries under covers</p>
<p class="poemline">splitting hairs between Baby Spice and Sporty Spice but really feeling Scary</p>
<p class="poemline">rice pudding, power outages by the living room fire</p>
<p class="poemline">Christmas lights and snow in the twilight in Virginia</p>
<p class="poemline">shredded gift wrappings wreathed around poking toes in socks</p>
<p class="poemline">life changing crises that could only paralyze a seven year old</p>
</div>

<p>But it never comes close to when I was this high, and I could barely reach the tabletops, inhaling the ample heat of the West African monsoon; not close enough to the tang of the Madd and Toll seeds, as sour as they were sweet, the roasting peanuts on coals and sand; kneeling by my grandmother’s feet as she sent for beignets and seared corn cobs from passing vendors. It never comes close to seeing my mother be a daughter, see her gently chided by her uncles, to watching telenovelas with my cousins until the sun came up, to lying on woven matting and simmering peppermint candies in buttermilk in Rosso, to watching B-list 80’s action films my aunt always took too seriously</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When my grandmother died I knew</p>
<p class="poemline">iota by iota I would liquefy and ebb apart</p>
<p class="poemline">until I was wave upon wave</p>
<p class="poemline">and so I did, wrapped around myself with folk rock in my ear</p>
<p class="poemline">until weeks became weeks upon weeks</p>
<p class="poemline">and time lost track of me, little pebble in seabed</p>
<p class="poemline">it does not matter, in the end, which version of childhood I hold true</p>
<p class="poemline">my grandmother died, taking with her all my definitions of mirth</p>
<p class="poemline">I was no longer a child by then</p>
<p class="poemline">but always found it cruel that I couldn’t pretend anymore</p>
<p class="poemline">nonetheless</p>
</div>
