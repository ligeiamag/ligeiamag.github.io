<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">If you were to name one of your children</p>
<p class="poemline">after a play by Shakespeare</p>
<p class="poemline">would you insist the name mimic the sound</p>
<p class="poemline">of a beating drum</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Bassianus, Saturninus?</p>
<p class="poemline">Or, would you shoot for something more delicate.</p>
<p class="poemline">Perhaps you would attempt to mimic the hum of a woman</p>
<p class="poemline">smearing lipstick onto her mouth</p>
<p class="poemline">or placing the finishing touches on her new car</p>
<p class="poemline">or maybe you would ask for something a little more saccharineâ€”</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Like, the ringing of a thousand bells</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Or the smell of a particular flower.</p>
</div>
