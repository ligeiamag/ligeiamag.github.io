## Moonwalker

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The night's face, pocked with stars.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">In the stellar wind, we soar.</p>
<p class="poemline">From this pale light,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">acknowledge insignificance, watch</p>
<p class="poemline">the blue spinning so far away, so close.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">I am that finite point</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">of nowhere, of nothing, wondering</p>
<p class="poemline">when the sun will truly darken,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">if I will see tomorrow, today.</p>
</div>

## Take Another Piece of My Heart

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Perhaps the left ventricle, or the anterior descending</p>
<p class="poemline">vein. No matter which you grab, I'll not survive</p>
<p class="poemline">the seizure, but is that not the point?  And which coin</p>
<p class="poemline">will you place in my mouth to ease the passage across</p>
<p class="poemline">the river Acheron? Or will I remain on the banks,</p>
<p class="poemline">neutral and overlooked, forgotten. If this river is woe,</p>
<p class="poemline">I serve its pride. I wear its banner. Do you recall the</p>
<p class="poemline">butcher's bill from that last flight? Sixty innocents,</p>
<p class="poemline">including children. How many more must we tally</p>
<p class="poemline">before admitting to the futility of perpetual war?</p>
<p class="poemline">An acquaintance on the ground that day saw the</p>
<p class="poemline">flash and immediately thought <em>there are no mistakes</em>,</p>
<p class="poemline">just as I, from my box in Nevada, admitted, too, that</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>no mistakes occur</em>, a synchronicity joined in death</p>
<p class="poemline">and its production. I no longer employ euphemism.</p>
<p class="poemline">When my coworker's eyes crinkle and he laughs</p>
<p class="poemline">about weeding the lawn of fun-sized terrorists,</p>
<p class="poemline">I see bloody children, mangled flesh, smoke and</p>
<p class="poemline">flame. I kill from comfort and afar. This is my life.</p>
