## We were in the mountains


<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">and we were in the mountains</p>
<p class="poemline">or what we thought were mountains. in Ireland you take</p>
<p class="poemline">what mountains you can get. and it was wicklow; near</p>
<p class="poemline">some unnamed lakes. the earth</p>
<p class="poemline">spongy with heather, and full of those trees</p>
<p class="poemline">grown for lumber, and some broken telephone poles - no nature</p>
<p class="poemline">anywhere. during the hot first afternoon</p>
<p class="poemline">we drank the beer we'd brought, ate chicken </p>
<p class="poemline">pink off barbecue wire. that night, three in a tent</p>
<p class="poemline">we huddled together</p>
<p class="poemline">with the third two-man</p>
<p class="poemline">relegated to storing fishing rods;</p>
<p class="poemline">we'd opened it on arrival </p>
<p class="poemline">and discovered it manky </p>
<p class="poemline">with black mold. next morning</p>
<p class="poemline">we were assailed by midges, and myself and jack</p>
<p class="poemline">volunteered to walk hours into town, </p>
<p class="poemline">then hitched back with winebottles, a bag of hamburgers</p>
<p class="poemline">and sausages bought cheap and well-expired. we were</p>
<p class="poemline">survivalists. cian and aodhain</p>
<p class="poemline">had stayed at our campsite</p>
<p class="poemline">and spent their day hunting branches. we planned</p>
<p class="poemline">a big fire, but couldn't get it lit. planned on fishing too; instead</p>
<p class="poemline">ate burgers, and quickly drank the wine. over moor and mountain</p>
<p class="poemline">gunshots fired, sounds pulled closer</p>
<p class="poemline">by prevailing winds - it was the time of year</p>
<p class="poemline">for deer and rabbit culls</p>
<p class="poemline">and people who knew the country.</p>

## Spring daily.

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">4:30pm. last work</p>
<p class="poemline">put to bed. boss is gone,</p>
<p class="poemline">but I'm paid to stay in</p>
<p class="poemline">until 5, in case there is a fire</p>
<p class="poemline">or any late calls</p>
<p class="poemline">for engineers. though at this time</p>
<p class="poemline">I can still put things away</p>
<p class="poemline">and begin smoking, reading a paperback</p>
<p class="poemline">and dreaming up ingredients</p>
<p class="poemline">for dinner. I pass my fingers</p>
<p class="poemline">through tangled wire, check my phone</p>
<p class="poemline">and pull sockets. sign off paperwork</p>
<p class="poemline">and have a last cup of coffee - why not?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">through the window</p>
<p class="poemline">and two floors up</p>
<p class="poemline">the birds are heading seaward</p>
<p class="poemline">toward the evening</p>
<p class="poemline">arrival of trawling boats. below them</p>
<p class="poemline">cars begin to thicken. 4:30pm</p>
<p class="poemline">is spring daily,</p>
<p class="poemline">even in winter</p>
<p class="poemline">and the brittlest frost -</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the roads</p>
<p class="poemline">all black branches;</p>
<p class="poemline">trees with traffic</p>
<p class="poemline">leaves.</p>
</div>
