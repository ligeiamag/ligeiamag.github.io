<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">When from blank swathes of canvas I learned</p>
<p class="poemline">To ask: 'How do I seem to mine own eyes?'</p>
<p class="poemline">First to nature&rsquo;s mirror, water, I turned, </p>
<p class="poemline">And besought the lake to tell me no lies.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">So earnestly for all the truth it strove,</p>
<p class="poemline">It trembled: and into shifting ripplets</p>
<p class="poemline">Parcelled my face; into prominence drove</p>
<p class="poemline">Now eyes, now nose, now mouth, now hair-ringlets.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Stricken, I sought then man&rsquo;s mirror of glass,</p>
<p class="poemline">Melted sand silvered to limpidity,</p>
<p class="poemline">And taxed in its self-shaped prison to pass</p>
<p class="poemline">Back each eye its rays with alacrity</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">So I looked: but found only the dulled gaze</p>
<p class="poemline">Of a wrinkled stranger; my cold shiver</p>
<p class="poemline">Cried: is it thus you see me in your glaze</p>
<p class="poemline">Or how I see myself in the mirror?</p>
</div>
