<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Twenty to thirty feet long</p>
<p class="poemline">and seldom seen but from</p>
<p class="poemline">low-flying private planes.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">No way in or out but by float plane</p>
<p class="poemline">or private boat when the river</p>
<p class="poemline">is high. But what a lake!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">More of an inland sea, really,</p>
<p class="poemline">at 77 miles long, 22 miles wide</p>
<p class="poemline">at its widest point. As deep as 988 feet.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Pilots report a blunt head—for ramming</p>
<p class="poemline">boats to dislodge tasty passengers?—</p>
<p class="poemline">and a dull aluminum-coloured, tapered body.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The beast has a vertical tail</p>
<p class="poemline">and never surfaces for air, so it can’t</p>
<p class="poemline">be a serpent, reptile, or whale.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Ergo, a fish. A freakish big fish</p>
<p class="poemline">capable of towing a Cessna by heavy gauge</p>
<p class="poemline">wire fishing line attached to a pontoon.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Towed it around the lake, leaving one pilot</p>
<p class="poemline">stunned as he fell into the moiling water.</p>
<p class="poemline">Fish towed the plane for miles before the line broke.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Some scientists have suggested the fish</p>
<p class="poemline">might be a white sturgeon. It’s big enough,</p>
<p class="poemline">and, being a bottom feeder, is seldom seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">But it’s got a crocodilian lumpy, bumpy hide</p>
<p class="poemline">and isn’t a dull aluminum. So <em>what</em> then?</p>
<p class="poemline">A cryptid species we know nothing about?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Aluminum torpedo fish? Folks claim</p>
<p class="poemline">it’s scarfed more than a few fishermen.</p>
<p class="poemline">Was regarded as a piscine god or other</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">before the white man arrived, hoping for</p>
<p class="poemline">a big fish fry. Now who’s got the blunt</p>
<p class="poemline">swollen heads? Who’s pushing water over</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">the gunwales of their leaky mental boats?</p>
<p class="poemline">Who’s the monster? Cryptid or scientist?</p>
<p class="poemline">Whose sharp fin is slicing through the water now?</p>
</div>
