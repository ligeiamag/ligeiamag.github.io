<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">It’s alive here</p>
<p class="poemline">and yet it seems so dead,</p>
<p class="poemline">a graveyard of bald cypress,</p>
<p class="poemline">bladderwort, sun-dew.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Fallen branches</p>
<p class="poemline">are adorned with turtle sculptures,</p>
<p class="poemline">lily pads, frog monuments,</p>
<p class="poemline">and there, on the surface</p>
<p class="poemline">of a brown, watery, mausoleum,</p>
<p class="poemline">two gator eyes freeze solemn.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">The air is thick and low</p>
<p class="poemline">like a shroud,</p>
<p class="poemline">once floating islands root-bound.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">If it weren’t for the slithering cottonmouth,</p>
<p class="poemline">there’d be no movement here at all.</p>
<p class="poemline">Ironic that.</p>
<p class="poemline">Signs of life</p>
<p class="poemline">come down to the deadliest.</p>
</div>
