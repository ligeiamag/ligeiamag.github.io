<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Lashed - tied with chunks of twine - and hung head down</p>
<p class="poemline">toward the dock, a knot of mackerel, thick sides flecked blue</p>
<p class="poemline">and black swayed - impassively - eyes weeping brine…Curing:</p>
<p class="poemline">under a merciless sun.  A little line of ladies filed by, pushing</p>
<p class="poemline">strollers: the tiny bodies, inside, nearly comatose.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">A bunch of fishermen, staggering like dry drunks, hosed clean</p>
<p class="poemline">the decks, readying the fleet. Readying for? What? a summer.</p>  
<p class="poemline">So hot I swear the walls were sweating…thermometers</p>
<p class="poemline">shattered (<em>some</em> said).  <em>Everyone</em> sheer lost their minds.</p>
<p class="poemline">(It was a miracle to make it through, each day…)</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">Then came the rain… The gutters overflowed, basements</p>
<p class="poemline">flooded, but the heat never broke.  That was when your old lady</p>
<p class="poemline">busted-in, harassed me with: what kind of person takes off with</p>
<p class="poemline">a crew he hardly knows: what’s he up to? As if I knew.  What</p>
<p class="poemline">the hell? To be frank, I was tired, dead tired. Still I spent half the night</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">trying, driving, asking “have you…” And what not.</p>
<p class="poemline">Revived - but not rested – before dawn by sirens, I <em>knew</em>.</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>But</em> it was too late (for answers). And then there were more crabbed</p>
<p class="poemline">questions. “Where did he get that? Why’d he have to draw? What</p>
<p class="poemline">drove him to shoot…?  They had no clue.  But I knew</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">you - the old ways – remade new: crystallized (though the design</p>
<p class="poemline">of you, ingrained, remained) now brought to bold relief.  All of-a piece.</p>
<p class="poemline">All of-an order: thick as flies, hovering beside the chalk outline,</p>
<p class="poemline">near the lip of the tracks, beside a bed of gravel, they gawked,</p>
<p class="poemline">and gathered. And then, another chorus of <em>whys</em>.  But already the odd oval</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="poemline">that fetal held you, was fading, under fresh rain.</p>
<p class="poemline"><em>I can</em> tell you, if you really want me to</p>
<p class="poemline">be perfectly frank, I can <em>tell you</em> why, <em>(just)</em></p>
<p class="poemline"><em>why</em> (point blank): those fish heads</p>
<p class="poemline">were shining.</p>
</div>
