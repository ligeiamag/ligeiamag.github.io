<div class="stanza">
  <p class="poemline">Brazen, she walks shamelessly barefoot and in rags.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Her hair in dread locks,</p>
  <p class="poemline">Wriggles around the bunch of sadness and ugliness.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Ugliness is what others see.</p>
  <p class="poemline">And filth.</p>
  <p class="poemline">All that filth that covers the years of misery and hardship.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Who cares?</p>
  <p class="poemline">Dirt is all they see.</p>
  <p class="poemline">No wrinkle carries anything visible except the extract of grime.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Wails of sirens and toxins surround her.</p>
  <p class="poemline">The city of despair,</p>
  <p class="poemline">Bare, ignorant, pushy, fast.</p>
  <p class="poemline">No one sees her.</p>
  <p class="poemline">But many look at her with contempt.</p>
  <p class="poemline">She walks.</p>
  <p class="poemline">All her cardboards break the dullness of city noises,</p>
  <p class="poemline">With their simple swishing.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Nothing else.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Reminder to the books she had read when she was a child.</p>
  <p class="poemline">With her father.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Long gone.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Joyless wasting of nerves and memory.</p>
  <p class="poemline">Peace of mind is all one needs.</p>
  <p class="poemline">She walks, she drags her bare feet.</p>
  <p class="poemline">They are cold.</p>
